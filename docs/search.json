    "text": "Statistics is the science of learning from data under uncertainty.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nStatistics is the science of collecting, organizing, analyzing, interpreting, and presenting data. It encompasses both the methods for working with data and the theoretical foundations that justify these methods. But statistics is more than just numbers and formulas—it’s a way of thinking about uncertainty and variation in the world around us.\n\n\n\n\n\nSelect a representative group of people to survey\nCalculate meaningful summaries from their responses\nEstimate the likely average for the entire population\nQuantify how confident you can be in your estimate\nTest whether the average age is changing over time\n\n\n\nDemography is the scientific study of human populations, focusing on their size, structure, distribution, and changes over time. It’s essentially the statistical analysis of people - who they are, where they live, how many there are, and how these characteristics evolve.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPercent vs Percentage Points (pp)\n\n\n\nWhen news reports say “unemployment decreased by 2,” do they mean 2 percentage points (pp) or 2 percent?\nThese are not the same:\n\n2 pp (absolute change): e.g., 10% → 8% (−2 pp).\n2% (relative change): multiply the old rate by 0.98; e.g., 10% → 9.8% (−0.2 pp).\n\nAlways ask:\n\nWhat is the baseline (earlier rate)?\nIs the change absolute (pp) or relative (%)?\nCould this be sampling error / random variation?\nHow was unemployment measured (survey vs. administrative), when, and who’s included?\n\nRule of thumb\n\nUse percentage points (pp) when comparing rates directly (unemployment, turnout).\nUse percent (%) for relative changes (proportional to the starting value).\n\nTiny lookup table\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStarting rate\n“Down 2%” (relative)\n“Down 2 pp” (absolute)\n\n\n\n\n6%\n6% × 0.98 = 5.88% (−0.12 pp)\n4%\n\n\n8%\n8% × 0.98 = 7.84% (−0.16 pp)\n6%\n\n\n10%\n10% × 0.98 = 9.8% (−0.2 pp)\n8%\n\n\n\nUwaga (PL): 2% ≠ 2 punkty procentowe (pp).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRounding and Scientific Notation in Statistics\n\n\n\nMain Rule: Unless otherwise specified, round the decimal parts of decimal numbers to at least 2 significant figures. In statistics, we often work with long decimal parts and very small numbers — don’t round excessively in intermediate steps, round at the end of calculations.\n\nRounding in Statistical Context\nThe decimal part consists of digits after the decimal point. In statistics, it’s particularly important to maintain appropriate precision:\nDescriptive statistics:\n\nMean: \\bar{x} = 15.847693... \\rightarrow 15.85\nStandard deviation: s = 2.7488... \\rightarrow 2.75\nCorrelation coefficient: r = 0.78432... \\rightarrow 0.78\n\nVery small numbers (p-values, probabilities):\n\np = 0.000347... \\rightarrow 0.00035 or 3.5 \\times 10^{-4}\nP(X &gt; 2) = 0.0000891... \\rightarrow 0.000089 or 8.9 \\times 10^{-5}\n\n\n\nSignificant Figures in Decimal Parts\nIn the decimal part, significant figures are all digits except leading zeros:\n\n.78432 has 5 significant figures → round to .78 (2 s.f.)\n.000347 has 3 significant figures → round to .00035 (2 s.f.)\n.050600 has 4 significant figures → round to .051 (2 s.f.)\n\n\n\nRounding Rules in Statistics\n\nRound only the decimal part to at least 2 significant figures\nThe integer part remains unchanged\nIn long calculations keep 3-4 digits in the decimal part until the final step\nNEVER round to zero - small values have interpretive significance\nFor very small numbers use scientific notation when it improves readability\nP-values often require greater precision — keep 2-3 significant figures\n\n⚠️ WARNING: Don’t round to zero!\n\n\nScientific Notation in Statistics\nIn statistics, we often encounter very small numbers. Use scientific notation when it improves readability:\nP-values and probabilities:\n\np = 0.000347 = 3.47 \\times 10^{-4} (better: 3.5 \\times 10^{-4})\nP(Z &gt; 3.5) = 0.000233 = 2.33 \\times 10^{-4}\n\nVery small standard deviations:\n\n\\sigma = 0.000892 = 8.92 \\times 10^{-4}\n\nLarge numbers (rare in basic statistics):\n\nN = 1\\,234\\,567 = 1.23 \\times 10^6\n\nWhen in doubt: Better to keep an extra digit than to round too aggressively\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescriptive Statistics\nDescriptive Statistics involves methods for summarizing and presenting data in meaningful ways. This includes:\nMeasures of Central Tendency - Where is the center of your data?\n\nMean: The arithmetic average. If the total household income in a village of 100 households is $5,000,000, the mean income is $50,000. However, if one household is extremely wealthy, this might not represent the typical household well.\nMedian: The middle value when data is ordered. If most households earn between $20,000-$40,000 but one earns $2,000,000, the median better represents the typical household.\nMode: The most frequent value. In studying family size, if most families have 2 children, 2 is the mode, even if the mean is 2.3 children.\n\nMeasures of Variability - How spread out is your data?\n\nRange: The difference between maximum and minimum values. If ages in a community range from 0 to 95 years, the range is 95 years.\nVariance: The average squared deviation from the mean. Measures how far values typically fall from the center.\nStandard Deviation: The square root of variance, in the same units as the original data. If the mean age is 35 years with a standard deviation of 20 years, most people are between 15 and 55 years old.\n\nVisual Representations (examples)\n\nPopulation Pyramids: Show age and sex distribution, revealing demographic history. A wide base indicates high birth rates; a narrow base suggests declining fertility.\nLife Tables: Summarize mortality patterns, showing the probability of surviving to each age.\nTime Series Graphs: Display trends over time, such as changing fertility rates across decades.\n\n\n\n\nhttps://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:%C5%81%C3%B3d%C5%BA_population_pyramid.svg\n\n\n\n\nInferential Statistics\nStatistical inference means using a sample to learn about a population. We estimate effects, describe uncertainty (margin of error, confidence interval), and ask whether results could be explained by chance—across experiments (treatment vs. control), regression (how changes in X relate to Y), and surveys (estimating proportions or means for the whole population).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Soup-Tasting Analogy\n\n\n\n\nConsider a chef preparing soup for 100 people who needs to assess its flavor without consuming the entire batch:\nPopulation: The entire pot of soup (100 servings)\nSample: A single spoonful for tasting\nPopulation Parameter: The true average saltiness of the complete pot (unknown)\nSample Statistic: The saltiness level detected in the spoonful (observable)\nStatistical Inference: Using the spoonful’s characteristics to draw conclusions about the entire pot\n\nKey Principles\n1. Random sampling is essential: The chef must thoroughly stir the soup before sampling. Consistently sampling from the surface might miss seasoning that has settled, introducing systematic bias.\n2. Sample size affects precision: A larger spoonful provides more reliable information about overall flavor than a small sip, though practical constraints (costs, time) limit sample size.\n3. Uncertainty is inherent: Even with proper sampling technique, the spoonful might not perfectly represent the entire pot’s characteristics.\n4. Systematic bias undermines inference: If someone secretly adds salt only to the sampling area, conclusions about the whole pot become invalid—illustrating how sampling bias distorts statistical inference.\n5. Inference has scope limitations: The sample can estimate average saltiness but cannot reveal whether some portions are saltier than others, highlighting the limits of what samples can tell us about population variability.\nThis analogy captures the essence of statistical reasoning: using carefully selected samples to learn about larger populations while explicitly acknowledging and quantifying the inherent uncertainty in this process.\n\n\n\nFor example, if a survey of 1,000 households finds that 23% include three generations living together, inferential statistics helps us:\n\nEstimate that between 20% and 26% of all households in the population likely have this structure (confidence interval)\nTest whether this percentage has increased compared to a decade ago (hypothesis testing)\nExamine whether multigenerational living is more common in certain ethnic groups (comparison of groups)\nPredict future trends based on current patterns (regression and forecasting)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nFundamental Principle: Statistics does not eliminate uncertainty—it helps us measure, manage, and communicate it effectively.\n\n\n\n\nStatistical Thinking: A Quick Start\n\nThe Scenario\nYour university is considering keeping the library open 24/7. The administration needs to know: What proportion of students support this change?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Fundamental Challenge\n\n\n\nIdeal world: Ask all 20,000 students → Get the exact answer\nReal world: Survey 100 students → Get an estimate with uncertainty\n\n\n\n\nTwo Approaches to the Same Data\nImagine you survey 100 random students and find that 60 support the 24/7 library hours.\n\n\n❌ Without Statistical Thinking\n“60 out of 100 students said yes.”\nConclusion: “Exactly 60% of all students support it.”\nDecision: “Since it’s over 50%, we have clear majority support.”\nProblem: Ignores that a different sample might give 55% or 65%\n\n✅ With Statistical Thinking\n“60 out of 100 students said yes.”\nConclusion: “We estimate 60% support, with a margin of error of ±10%”\nDecision: “True support is likely between 50% and 70%—we need more data to be certain of majority support.”\nAdvantage: Acknowledges uncertainty and informs better decisions\n\n\n\n\nWhy This Matters\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Key Insight\n\n\n\nStatistical thinking isn’t about being less certain—it’s about being honest about our uncertainty.\nConsider these scenarios with your 60% result (±10% margin):\n\nBest case: True support could be 70% (strong majority)\nWorst case: True support could be 50% (no clear majority)\nMost likely: True support is near 60% (moderate majority)\n\nWithout acknowledging this range, you might make costly decisions based on false precision.\n\n\n\n\nThe Power of Sample Size\nWhat if we need more precision? Here’s how sample size affects our confidence:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSample Size\nYour Result\nMargin of Error\nConfidence Interval\nInterpretation\n\n\n\n\nn = 100\n60%\n±10%\n50% to 70%\nUncertain about majority\n\n\nn = 400\n60%\n±5%\n55% to 65%\nLikely majority support\n\n\nn = 1,600\n60%\n±2.5%\n57.5% to 62.5%\nClear majority support\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRemember\n\n\n\nStatistical thinking transforms “60 students said yes” from a precise-sounding but misleading statement into an honest assessment: “We’re reasonably confident that between 50% and 70% of all students support this.”\nThis humility leads to better decisions.\n\n\n\n\nYour Turn to Think Statistically\nNext time you see a statistic, ask yourself:\n\nWhat’s the sample size?\nWhat’s the margin of statistical error?\nCould the true value be meaningfully different from what’s reported?\nWould my decision change if the true value were at the edge of the uncertainty range?\n\nThese questions are the foundation of statistical thinking.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHistorical Example: The 1936 Literary Digest Poll\n\n\n\nThe Literary Digest conducted one of the largest polls in history with 2.4 million responses, predicting Alf Landon would defeat Franklin D. Roosevelt in the 1936 presidential election.\nDespite the massive sample size:\nPrediction: Landon 57%, Roosevelt 43%\nActual Result: Roosevelt 62%, Landon 38%\nError: 25 percentage points!\nWhat went wrong? The poll suffered from systematic bias:\nSelection bias in sampling frame:\n\nSources: telephone directories, automobile registrations, club memberships\nProblem: In 1936, these sources overrepresented wealthy Americans who favored Landon\nResult: The sample systematically excluded Roosevelt supporters\n\nNon-response bias:\n\nOnly 24% of those contacted responded (low response rate)\nLikely respondents: those with strong anti-Roosevelt opinions\nNon-respondents: many Roosevelt supporters didn’t feel compelled to participate\n\nKey Lessons:\n\nA large biased sample is worse than a small representative sample\nStandard errors only measure random error, not bias\n\nSample size cannot fix fundamental sampling problems\nRepresentative sampling matters more than sample size\n\nThis disaster led to major improvements in polling methodology, including the development of probability sampling and response rate tracking.\n\n\n\n\n\nModern Polling\nToday’s polls, while much smaller than the Literary Digest’s 2.4 million responses, are far more accurate because they focus on:\nRepresentative sampling: Using probability-based methods to ensure all groups have known chances of selection\nBias detection and correction: Monitoring response rates across demographics and adjusting for known biases\nUncertainty quantification: Reporting margins of statistical error that honestly communicate the limits of what we know\nExample: A modern poll of 1,000 randomly selected voters with a 3% margin of error is far more reliable than the Literary Digest’s massive but biased survey.",

The type of data determines what mathematical operations (e.g. multiplication) are meaningful and what statistical methods apply.\n\nQuantitative Data\nContinuous Data can take any value within a range:\nExamples with Demographic Relevance:\n\nAge: Can be 25.5 years, 25.51 years, 25.514 years (precision limited only by measurement)\nBody Mass Index: 23.7 kg/m²\nFertility Rate: 1.73 children per woman\nPopulation Density: 4,521.3 people per km²\n\nProperties:\n\nCan perform all arithmetic operations\nCan calculate means, standard deviations\nOften follow known probability distributions (e.g. weight and Normal distribution)\n\nDiscrete Data can only take specific values:\nExamples:\n\nNumber of Children: 0, 1, 2, 3… (can’t have 2.5 children)\nNumber of Marriages: 0, 1, 2, 3…\nHousehold Size: 1, 2, 3, 4… people\nNumber of Doctor Visits: 0, 1, 2, 3… per year\n\n\n\nQualitative/Categorical Data\nNominal Data represents categories with no inherent order:\nExamples:\n\nCountry of Birth: USA, China, India, Brazil…\nReligion: Christian, Muslim, Hindu, Buddhist, None…\nMarital Status: Single, Married, Divorced, Widowed\nCause of Death: Heart disease, Cancer, Accident, Stroke…\nBlood Type: A, B, AB, O\n\nWhat We Can Do:\n\nCount frequencies\nCalculate proportions\nFind mode\nTest for independence\n\nWhat We Cannot Do:\n\nCalculate mean (average religion makes no sense)\nOrder categories meaningfully\nCompute distances between categories\n\nOrdinal Data represents ordered categories:\nExamples:\n\nEducation Level: None &lt; Primary &lt; Secondary &lt; Tertiary\nSocioeconomic Status: Low &lt; Middle &lt; High\nSelf-Rated Health: Poor &lt; Fair &lt; Good &lt; Excellent\nAgreement Scale: Strongly Disagree &lt; Disagree &lt; Neutral &lt; Agree &lt; Strongly Agree\n\nThe Challenge: Intervals between categories aren’t necessarily equal. The “distance” from Poor to Fair health may not equal the distance from Good to Excellent.\n\n\n\nData Distribution\nA data distribution describes how values spread across possible outcomes (what values and how often a variable takes). Distributions tell us what values are common, what values are rare, and what patterns exist in our data.\nUnderstanding distributions is fundamental to statistics because it helps us summarize large datasets, identify patterns, and make informed decisions.\nFor example, knowing that most students score between 60-80 on an exam tells us more than just knowing the average score.\n\nFrequency, Relative Frequency, and Density\nWhen we analyze data, we’re often interested in how many times each value (or range of values) appears. This leads us to three related concepts:\n(Absolute) Frequency is simply the count of how many times a particular value or category occurs in your data. If 15 students scored between 70-80 points on an exam, the frequency for that range is 15.\nRelative frequency expresses frequency as a proportion or percentage of the total. It answers the question: “What fraction of all observations fall into this category?” Relative frequency is calculated as:\n\\text{Relative Frequency} = \\frac{\\text{Frequency}}{\\text{Total Number of Observations}}\nIf 15 out of 100 students scored 70-80 points, the relative frequency is 15/100 = 0.15 or 15%. Relative frequencies always sum to 1 (or 100%), making them useful for comparing distributions with different sample sizes.\nDensity is similar to relative frequency but accounts for the width of intervals. When we group continuous data (like time or unemployment rate) into bins of different widths, density ensures fair comparison. Density is calculated as:\n\\text{Density} = \\frac{\\text{Relative Frequency}}{\\text{Interval Width}}\nDensity is particularly important for continuous variables because it ensures that the total area under the distribution equals 1, which allows us to interpret areas as probabilities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThe probability of an event is a number between 0 and 1; the larger the probability, the more likely an event is to occur.\n\n\nCumulative frequency tells us how many observations fall at or below a certain value. Instead of asking “how many observations are in this category?”, cumulative frequency answers “how many observations are in this category or any category below it?” It’s calculated by adding up all frequencies from the lowest value up to and including the current value.\nSimilarly, cumulative relative frequency expresses this as a proportion of the total, answering “what percentage of observations fall at or below this value?” This is particularly useful for understanding percentiles and quartiles. For example, if the cumulative relative frequency at score 70 is 0.40, this means 40% of students scored 70 or below.\n\n\nDistribution Tables\nA frequency distribution table organizes data by showing how observations are distributed across different values or intervals. Here’s an example with exam scores:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScore Range\nFrequency\nRelative Frequency\nCumulative Frequency\nCumulative Relative Frequency\nDensity\n\n\n\n\n0-50\n10\n0.10\n10\n0.10\n0.002\n\n\n50-70\n30\n0.30\n40\n0.40\n0.015\n\n\n70-90\n45\n0.45\n85\n0.85\n0.0225\n\n\n90-100\n15\n0.15\n100\n1.00\n0.015\n\n\nTotal\n100\n1.00\n-\n-\n-\n\n\n\nThis table immediately reveals that most students scored in the 70-90 range, while very few scored below 50 or above 90. The cumulative columns show us that 40% of students scored below 70, and 85% scored below 90. Such tables are invaluable for getting a quick overview of your data before conducting more complex analyses.\n\n\nVisualizing Distributions: Histograms\nA histogram is a graphical representation of a frequency distribution. It displays data using bars where:\n\nThe x-axis shows the values or intervals (bins)\nThe y-axis can show frequency, relative frequency, or density\nThe height of each bar represents the count, proportion, or density for that interval\nBars touch each other (no gaps) for continuous variables\n\nChoosing bin widths: The number and width of bins significantly affects how your histogram looks. Too few bins hide important patterns, while too many bins create “noise” and make patterns hard to see.\n\nIn statistics, noise is unwanted random variation that obscures the pattern we’re trying to find. Think of it like static on a radio—it makes the music (the “signal”) harder to hear. In data, noise comes from measurement errors, random fluctuations, or the inherent variability in what we’re studying. Noise is random variation in data that hides the real patterns we want to see, similar to how background noise makes conversation difficult to hear.\n\nSeveral approaches help determine appropriate bin widths:\n\nSturges’ rule: Use k = 1 + \\log_2(n) bins, where n is the sample size. This works well for roughly symmetric distributions.\nSquare root rule: Use k = \\sqrt{n} bins. A simple, reasonable default for many situations.\n\nIn R, you can specify bins in several ways:\n\n# Specify number of bins\nhist(exam_scores, breaks = 10)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Specify exact break points\nhist(exam_scores, breaks = seq(0, 100, by = 10))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Let R choose automatically (uses Sturges' rule by default)\nhist(exam_scores)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe best approach is often to experiment with different bin widths to find what best reveals your data’s pattern. Start with a default, then try fewer and more bins to see how the story changes.\nDefining bin boundaries: When creating bins for a frequency table, you must decide how to handle values that fall exactly on the boundaries. For example, if you have bins 0-10 and 10-20, which bin does the value 10 belong to?\nThe solution is to use interval notation to specify whether each boundary is included or excluded:\n\nClosed interval [a, b] includes both endpoints: a \\leq x \\leq b\nOpen interval (a, b) excludes both endpoints: a &lt; x &lt; b\nHalf-open interval [a, b) includes the left endpoint but excludes the right: a \\leq x &lt; b\nHalf-open interval (a, b] excludes the left endpoint but includes the right: a &lt; x \\leq b\n\nStandard convention: Most statistical software, including R, uses left-closed, right-open intervals [a, b) for all bins except the last one, which is fully closed [a, b]. This means:\n\nThe value at the lower boundary is included in the bin\nThe value at the upper boundary belongs to the next bin\nThe very last bin includes both boundaries to capture the maximum value\n\nFor example, with bins 0-20, 20-40, 40-60, 60-80, 80-100:\n\n\n\nScore Range\nInterval Notation\nValues Included\n\n\n\n\n0-20\n[0, 20)\n0 ≤ score &lt; 20\n\n\n20-40\n[20, 40)\n20 ≤ score &lt; 40\n\n\n40-60\n[40, 60)\n40 ≤ score &lt; 60\n\n\n60-80\n[60, 80)\n60 ≤ score &lt; 80\n\n\n80-100\n[80, 100]\n80 ≤ score ≤ 100\n\n\n\nThis convention ensures that:\n\nEvery value is counted exactly once (no double-counting)\nNo values fall through the cracks\nThe bins partition the entire range completely\n\nWhen presenting frequency tables in reports, you can simply write “0-20, 20-40, …” and note that bins are left-closed, right-open, or explicitly show the interval notation if precision is important.\nFrequency histogram shows the raw counts:\n\n# R code example\nhist(exam_scores, \n     breaks = seq(0, 100, by = 10),\n     main = \"Distribution of Exam Scores\",\n     xlab = \"Score\",\n     ylab = \"Frequency\",\n     col = \"lightblue\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelative frequency histogram shows proportions (useful when comparing groups of different sizes):\n\nhist(exam_scores, \n     breaks = seq(0, 100, by = 10),\n     freq = FALSE,  # This creates relative frequency/density\n     main = \"Distribution of Exam Scores\",\n     xlab = \"Score\",\n     ylab = \"Relative Frequency\",\n     col = \"lightgreen\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDensity histogram adjusts for interval width and is used with density curves:\n\nhist(exam_scores, \n     breaks = seq(0, 100, by = 10),\n     freq = FALSE,  # Creates density scale\n     main = \"Distribution of Exam Scores\",\n     xlab = \"Score\",\n     ylab = \"Density\",\n     col = \"lightcoral\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDensity Curves\nA density curve is a smooth line that approximates/models the shape of a distribution. Unlike histograms that show actual data in discrete bins, density curves show the overall pattern as a continuous function. The area under the entire curve always equals 1, and the area under any portion of the curve represents the proportion of observations in that range.\n\n# Adding a density curve to a histogram\nhist(exam_scores, \n     freq = FALSE,\n     main = \"Exam Scores with Density Curve\",\n     xlab = \"Score\",\n     ylab = \"Density\",\n     col = \"lightblue\",\n     border = \"white\")\nlines(density(exam_scores), \n      col = \"darkred\", \n      lwd = 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDensity curves are particularly useful for:\n\nIdentifying the shape of the distribution (symmetric, skewed, bimodal)\nComparing multiple distributions on the same plot\nUnderstanding the theoretical (true) distribution underlying your data\n\n\n\nVisualizing Cumulative Frequency\nCumulative frequency plots, also called ogives (pronounced “oh-jive”), display how frequencies accumulate across values. These plots use lines rather than bars and always increase from left to right, eventually reaching the total number of observations (for cumulative frequency) or 1.0 (for cumulative relative frequency).\nCumulative frequency plots are excellent for:\n\nFinding percentiles and quartiles visually\nDetermining what proportion of data falls below or above a certain value\nComparing distributions of different groups\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIn statistics, a percentile indicates the relative position of a data point within a dataset by showing the percentage of observations that fall at or below that value. For example, if a student scores at the 90th percentile on a test, their score is equal to or higher than 90% of all other scores.\nQuartiles are special percentiles that divide data into four equal parts: the first quartile (Q1, 25th percentile), second quartile (Q2, 50th percentile, also the median), and third quartile (Q3, 75th percentile). If Q1 = 65 points, then 25% of students scored 65 or below.\nMore generally, quantiles are values that divide data into equal-sized groups—percentiles divide into 100 parts, quartiles into 4 parts, deciles into 10 parts, and so on.\n\n\n\n# Creating cumulative frequency data\nscore_breaks &lt;- seq(0, 100, by = 10)\nfreq_counts &lt;- hist(exam_scores, breaks = score_breaks, plot = FALSE)$counts\ncumulative_freq &lt;- cumsum(freq_counts)\n\n# Plotting cumulative frequency\nplot(score_breaks[-1], cumulative_freq,\n     type = \"b\",  # both points and lines\n     main = \"Cumulative Frequency of Exam Scores\",\n     xlab = \"Score\",\n     ylab = \"Cumulative Frequency\",\n     col = \"darkblue\",\n     lwd = 2,\n     pch = 19)\ngrid()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor cumulative relative frequency (which is more commonly used):\n\n# Cumulative relative frequency\ncumulative_rel_freq &lt;- cumulative_freq / length(exam_scores)\n\nplot(score_breaks[-1], cumulative_rel_freq,\n     type = \"b\",\n     main = \"Cumulative Relative Frequency of Exam Scores\",\n     xlab = \"Score\",\n     ylab = \"Cumulative Relative Frequency\",\n     col = \"darkred\",\n     lwd = 2,\n     pch = 19,\n     ylim = c(0, 1))\ngrid()\nabline(h = c(0.25, 0.5, 0.75), lty = 2, col = \"gray\")  # Quartile lines\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe cumulative relative frequency curve makes it easy to read percentiles. For example, if you draw a horizontal line at 0.75 and see where it intersects the curve, the corresponding x-value is the 75th percentile—the score below which 75% of students fall.\n\n\nDiscrete vs. Continuous Distributions\nThe type of variable you’re analyzing determines how you visualize its distribution:\nDiscrete distributions apply to variables that can only take specific, countable values. Examples include number of children in a family (0, 1, 2, 3…), number of customer complaints per day, or responses on a 5-point Likert scale.\nFor discrete data, we typically use:\n\nBar charts (with gaps between bars) rather than histograms\nFrequency or relative frequency on the y-axis\nEach distinct value gets its own bar\n\n\n# Example: Number of children per family\nchildren &lt;- c(0, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 0, 2, 1, 4, 2, 1, 0, 2, 3)\nbarplot(table(children),\n        main = \"Distribution of Number of Children\",\n        xlab = \"Number of Children\",\n        ylab = \"Frequency\",\n        col = \"skyblue\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContinuous distributions apply to variables that can take any value within a range. Examples include temperature, response time, height, or turnout percentage.\nFor continuous data, we use:\n\nHistograms (with touching bars) that group data into intervals\nDensity curves to show the smooth pattern\nDensity on the y-axis when using density curves\n\n\n# Example: Response time distribution\nhist(response_time, \n     breaks = 15,\n     freq = FALSE,\n     main = \"Distribution of Response Time\",\n     xlab = \"Response Time (seconds)\",\n     ylab = \"Density\",\n     col = \"lightgreen\",\n     border = \"white\")\nlines(density(response_time), \n      col = \"darkgreen\", \n      lwd = 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe key difference is that discrete distributions show probability at specific points, while continuous distributions show probability density across ranges. For continuous variables, the probability of any exact value is essentially zero—instead, we talk about the probability of falling within an interval.\nUnderstanding whether your variable is discrete or continuous guides your choice of visualization and statistical methods, ensuring your analysis accurately represents the nature of your data.\n\n\nDescribing Distributions\nShape Characteristics:\nSymmetry vs. Skewness:\n\nSymmetric: Mirror image around center (example: heights in homogeneous population)\nRight-skewed (positive skew): Long tail to right (example: income, wealth)\nLeft-skewed (negative skew): Long tail to left (example: age at death in developed countries)\n\nExample of Skewness Impact:\nIncome distribution in the U.S.:\n\nMedian household income: ~$70,000\nMean household income: ~$100,000\nMean &gt; Median indicates right skew\nA few very high incomes pull the mean up\n\n\nModality:\n\nUnimodal: One peak (example: test scores)\nBimodal: Two peaks (example: height when mixing males and females)\nMultimodal: Multiple peaks (example: age distribution in a college town—peaks at college age and middle age)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant Probability Distributions:\nNormal (Gaussian) Distribution:\n\nBell-shaped, symmetric\nCharacterized by mean (\\mu) and standard deviation (\\sigma)\nAbout 68% of values within \\mu \\pm \\sigma\nAbout 95% within \\mu \\pm 2\\sigma\nAbout 99.7% within \\mu \\pm 3\\sigma\n\nDemographic Applications:\n\nHeights within homogeneous populations\nMeasurement errors\nSampling distributions of means (Central Limit Theorem)\n\nBinomial Distribution:\n\nNumber of successes in n independent trials\nEach trial has probability p of success\nMean = np, Variance = np(1-p)\n\nExample: Number of male births out of 100 births (p \\approx 0.512)\nPoisson Distribution:\n\nCount of events in fixed time/space\nMean = Variance = \\lambda\nGood for rare events\n\nDemographic Applications:\n\nNumber of deaths per day in small town\nNumber of births per hour in hospital\nNumber of accidents at intersection per month\n\n\n\n\nVisualizing Frequency Distributions\nHistogram: For continuous data, shows frequency with bar heights.\n\nX-axis: Value ranges (bins)\nY-axis: Frequency or density\nNo gaps between bars (continuous data)\nBin width affects appearance\n\nBar Chart: For categorical data, shows frequency with separated bars.\n\nX-axis: Categories\nY-axis: Frequency\nGaps between bars (discrete categories)\nOrder may or may not matter\n\nCumulative Distribution Function (CDF): Shows proportion of values ≤ each point of data.\n\nAlways increases (or stays flat)\nStarts at 0, ends at 1\nSteep slopes indicate common values\nFlat areas indicate rare values\n\nBox Plot (Box-and-Whisker Plot): A visual summary that displays the distribution’s key statistics using five key values.\nThe Five-Number Summary:\n\nMinimum: Leftmost whisker end (excluding outliers)\nQ1 (First Quartile): Left edge of the box (25th percentile)\nMedian (Q2): Line inside the box (50th percentile)\n\nQ3 (Third Quartile): Right edge of the box (75th percentile)\nMaximum: Rightmost whisker end (excluding outliers)\n\nWhat It Reveals:\n\nSkewness: If median line is off-center in the box, or whiskers are unequal\nSpread: Wider boxes and longer whiskers indicate more variability\nOutliers: Immediately visible as separate points\nSymmetry: Equal whisker lengths and centered median suggest normal distribution\n\nQuick Interpretation:\n\nNarrow box = consistent data\nLong whiskers = wide range of values\n\nMany outliers = potential data quality issues or interesting extreme cases\nMedian closer to Q1 = right-skewed data (tail extends right)\nMedian closer to Q3 = left-skewed data (tail extends left)\n\nBox plots are especially useful for comparing multiple groups side-by-side!",

    "text": "1.3 Populations and Samples\nUnderstanding the distinction between populations and samples is crucial for proper statistical analysis. This distinction affects every aspect of our analysis, from planning data collection to interpreting results.\n\nPopulation\nA population is the complete set of individuals, objects, or measurements about which we wish to draw conclusions. The key word here is “complete”—a population includes every single member of the group we’re studying.\nExamples of Populations in Demography:\n\nAll residents of India as of January 1, 2024: This includes every person living in India on that specific date—approximately 1.4 billion people.\nAll births in Sweden during 2023: Every baby born within Swedish borders during that calendar year—roughly 100,000 births.\nAll households in Tokyo: Every residential unit where people live, cook, and sleep separately from others—about 7 million households.\nAll deaths from COVID-19 worldwide in 2020: Every death where COVID-19 was listed as a cause—several million deaths.\n\nPopulations can be:\nFinite: Having a countable number of members (all current U.S. citizens, all Polish municipalities in 2024)\nInfinite: Theoretical or uncountably large (all possible future births)\nFixed: Defined at a specific point in time (all residents on census day)\nDynamic: Changing over time (the population of a city that experiences births, deaths, and migration daily)\n\n\nSample\nA sample is a subset of the population that is actually observed or measured. We study samples because examining entire populations is often impossible, impractical, or unnecessary.\nWhy We Use Samples:\nPractical Impossibility: Imagine testing every person in China for a disease. By the time you finished testing 1.4 billion people, the disease situation would have changed completely, and some people tested early would need retesting.\nCost Considerations: The 2020 U.S. Census cost approximately $16 billion. Conducting such complete enumerations frequently would be prohibitively expensive. A well-designed sample survey can provide accurate estimates at a fraction of the cost.\nTime Constraints: Policy makers often need information quickly. A sample survey of 10,000 people can be completed in weeks, while a census takes years to plan, execute, and process.\nDestructive Measurement: Some measurements destroy what’s being measured. Testing the lifespan of light bulbs or the breaking point of materials requires using samples.\nGreater Accuracy: Surprisingly, samples can sometimes be more accurate than complete enumerations. With a sample, you can afford better training for interviewers, more careful data collection, and more thorough quality checks.\nExample of Sample vs. Population:\nLet’s say we want to know the average household size in New York City:\n\nPopulation: All 3.2 million households in NYC\nCensus approach: Attempt to contact every household (expensive, time-consuming, some will be missed)\nSample approach: Randomly select 5,000 households, carefully measure their sizes, and use this to estimate the average for all households\nResult: The sample might find an average of 2.43 people per household with a margin of error of ±0.05, meaning we’re confident the true population average is between 2.38 and 2.48",

    "text": "1.4 Superpopulation and Data Generating Process (DGP) (*)\n\n\nSuperpopulation\nA superpopulation is a theoretical infinite population from which your finite population is considered to be one random sample.\nThink of it in three levels:\n\nSuperpopulation: An infinite collection of possible values (theoretical)\nFinite population: The actual population you could theoretically census (e.g., all 50 US states, all 10,000 firms in an industry)\nSample: The subset you actually observe (e.g., 30 states, 500 firms)\n\nWhy do we need this concept?\nConsider the 50 US states. You might measure unemployment rate for all 50 states—a complete census, no sampling needed. But you still want to:\n\nTest if unemployment is related to education levels\nPredict next year’s unemployment rates\nDetermine if differences between states are “statistically significant”\n\nWithout the superpopulation concept, you’re stuck—you have all the data, so what’s left to infer? The answer: treat this year’s 50 values as one draw from an infinite superpopulation of possible values that could occur under similar conditions.\nMathematical representation:\n\nFinite population value: Y_i (state i’s unemployment rate)\nSuperpopulation model: Y_i = \\mu + \\epsilon_i where \\epsilon_i \\sim (0, \\sigma^2)\nThe 50 observed values are one realization of this process\n\n\n\n\nData Generating Process: The True Recipe\nThe Data Generating Process (DGP) is the actual mechanism that creates your data—including all factors, relationships, and random elements.\nAn intuitive example: Suppose student test scores are truly generated by:\n\\text{Score}_i = 50 + 2(\\text{StudyHours}_i) + 3(\\text{SleepHours}_i) - 5(\\text{Stress}_i) + 1.5(\\text{Breakfast}_i) + \\epsilon_i\nThis is the TRUE DGP. But you don’t know this! You might estimate:\n\\text{Score}_i = \\alpha + \\beta(\\text{StudyHours}_i) + u_i\nYour model is simpler than reality. You’re missing variables (sleep, stress, breakfast), so your estimates might be biased. The u_i term captures everything you missed.\nKey insight: We never know the true DGP. Our statistical models are always approximations, trying to capture the most important parts of the unknown, complex truth.\n\n\n\nTwo Approaches to Statistical Inference\nWhen analyzing data, especially from surveys or samples, we can take two philosophical approaches:\n\n1. Design-Based Inference\n\nPhilosophy: The population values are fixed numbers. Randomness comes ONLY from which units we happened to sample.\nFocus: How we selected the sample (simple random, stratified, cluster sampling, etc.)\nExample: The mean income of California counties is a fixed number. We sample 10 counties. Our uncertainty comes from which 10 we randomly selected.\nNo models needed: We don’t assume anything about the population values’ distribution\n\n\n\n2. Model-Based Inference\n\nPhilosophy: The population values themselves are realizations from some probability model (superpopulation)\nFocus: The statistical model generating the population values\nExample: Each California county’s income is drawn from: Y_i = \\mu + \\epsilon_i where \\epsilon_i \\sim N(0, \\sigma^2)\nModels required: We make assumptions about how the data were generated\n\nWhich is better?\n\nLarge populations, good random samples: Design-based works well\nSmall populations (like 50 states): Model-based often necessary\nComplete enumeration: Only model-based allows inference\nModern practice: Often combines both approaches\n\n\n\n\n\nPractical Example: Analyzing State Education Spending\nSuppose you collect education spending per pupil for all 50 US states.\nWithout superpopulation thinking:\n\nYou have all 50 values—that’s it\nThe mean is the mean, no uncertainty\nYou can’t test hypotheses or make predictions\n\nWith superpopulation thinking:\n\nThis year’s 50 values are one realization from a superpopulation\nModel: \\text{Spending}_i = \\mu + \\beta(\\text{StateIncome}_i) + \\epsilon_i\nNow you can:\n\nTest if spending relates to state income (\\beta \\neq 0?)\nPredict next year’s values\nCalculate confidence intervals\n\n\nThe key insight: Even with complete data, the superpopulation framework enables statistical inference by treating observed values as one possible outcome from an underlying stochastic process.\n\n\n\nSummary\n\nSuperpopulation: Treats your finite population as one draw from an infinite possibility space—essential when your finite population is small or completely observed\nDGP: The true (unknown) process creating your data—your models try to approximate it",

    "text": "1.5 Variables and Measurement Scales\n\nA variable is any characteristic that can take different values across units of observation.\n\n\nMeasurement: Transforming Concepts into Numbers\n\nThe Political World is Full of Data\nPolitical science has evolved from a primarily theoretical discipline to one that increasingly relies on empirical evidence. Whether we’re studying:\n\nElection outcomes: Why do people vote the way they do?\nPublic opinion: What shapes attitudes toward immigration or climate policy?\nInternational relations: What factors predict conflict between nations?\nPolicy effectiveness: Did a new education policy actually improve outcomes?\n\nWe need systematic ways to analyze data and draw conclusions that go beyond anecdotes and personal impressions.\n\nConsider this question: “Does democracy lead to economic growth?”\n\nYour intuition might suggest yes—democratic countries tend to be wealthier. But is this causation or correlation? Are there exceptions? How confident can we be in our conclusions?\nStatistics provides the tools to move from hunches to evidence-based answers, helping us distinguish between what seems true and what actually is true.\n\n\nThe Challenge of Measurement in Social Sciences\nIn social sciences, we often struggle with the fact that key concepts do not translate directly into numbers:\n\nHow do we measure “democracy”?\nWhat number captures “political ideology”?\nHow do we quantify “institutional strength”?\nHow do we measure “political participation”?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n🔍 Correlation ≠ Causation: Understanding Spurious Relationships\n\n\n\n\nThe Fundamental Distinction\nCorrelation measures how two variables move together:\n\nPositive: Both increase together (study hours ↑, grades ↑)\nNegative: One increases while other decreases (TV hours ↑, grades ↓)\nMeasured by correlation coefficient: r \\in [-1, 1]\n\nCausation means one variable directly influences another:\n\nX \\rightarrow Y: Changes in X directly cause changes in Y\nRequires: (1) correlation, (2) temporal precedence, (3) no alternative explanations\n\n\n\nThe Danger: Spurious Correlation\nA spurious correlation occurs when two variables appear related but are actually both influenced by a third variable (a confounder).\nClassic Example:\n\nObserved: Ice cream sales correlate with drowning deaths\nSpurious conclusion: Ice cream causes drowning (❌)\nReality: Summer weather (confounder) causes both:\nSummer → More ice cream sales\nSummer → More swimming → More drownings\n\nMathematical representation:\n\nObserved correlation: \\text{Cor}(X,Y) \\neq 0\nBut the true model: X = \\alpha Z + \\epsilon_1 and Y = \\beta Z + \\epsilon_2\nWhere Z is the confounding variable causing both\n\n\n\nConfounding: The Hidden Influence\nA confounding variable (confounder):\n\nAffects both the presumed cause and effect\nCreates an illusion of direct causation 3. Must be controlled for valid causal inference\n\nResearch Example:\n\nObserved: Coffee consumption correlates with heart disease\nPotential confounder: Smoking (coffee drinkers more likely to smoke)\nTrue relationships:\nSmoking → Heart disease (causal)\nSmoking → Coffee consumption (association)\nCoffee → Heart disease (spurious without controlling for smoking)\n\n\n\nHow to Identify Causal Relationships\n\nRandomized Controlled Trials (RCTs): Random assignment breaks confounding\nNatural Experiments: External events create “as-if” random variation\nStatistical Control: Include confounders in regression models\nInstrumental Variables: Find variables affecting X but not Y directly\n\n\n\nKey Takeaway\nFinding correlation is easy. Establishing causation is hard. Always ask: “What else could explain this relationship?”\nRemember: The most dangerous phrase in empirical research is “our data shows that X causes Y” when all you’ve measured is correlation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n📊 Quick Test: Correlation or Causation?\n\n\n\n\n\nFor each scenario, identify whether the relationship is likely causal or spurious:\n\nCities with more churches have more crime\n\nAnswer: Spurious (confounder: population size)\n\nSmoking leads to lung cancer\n\nAnswer: Causal (established through multiple study designs)\n\nStudents with more books at home get better grades\n\nAnswer: Likely spurious (confounders: parental education, income)\n\nCountries with higher chocolate consumption have more Nobel laureates\n\nAnswer: Spurious (confounder: wealth/development level)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTypes of Variables\nQuantitative Variables represent amounts or quantities and can be:\nContinuous Variables: Can take any value within a range, limited only by measurement precision.\n\nAge (22.5 years, 22.51 years, 22.514 years…)\nIncome ($45,234.67)\nHeight (175.3 cm)\nPopulation density (432.7 people per square kilometer)\n\nDiscrete Variables: Can only take specific values, usually counts.\n\nNumber of children in a family (0, 1, 2, 3…)\nNumber of marriages (0, 1, 2…)\nNumber of rooms in a dwelling (1, 2, 3…)\nNumber of migrants entering a country per year\n\nQualitative Variables represent categories or qualities and can be:\nNominal Variables: Categories with no inherent order.\n\nCountry of birth (USA, Mexico, Canada…)\nReligion (Christian, Muslim, Hindu, Buddhist…)\nBlood type (A, B, AB, O)\nCause of death (heart disease, cancer, accident…)\n\nOrdinal Variables: Categories with a meaningful order but unequal intervals.\n\nEducation level (no schooling, primary, secondary, tertiary)\nSatisfaction with healthcare (very dissatisfied, dissatisfied, neutral, satisfied, very satisfied)\nSocioeconomic status (low, middle, high)\nSelf-rated health (poor, fair, good, excellent)\n\n\n\nMeasurement Scales\nUnderstanding measurement scales is crucial because they determine which statistical methods are appropriate:\nNominal Scale: Categories only—we can count frequencies but cannot order or perform arithmetic. Example: We can say 45% of residents were born locally, but we cannot calculate an “average birthplace.”\nOrdinal Scale: Order matters but differences between values are not necessarily equal. Example: The difference between “poor” and “fair” health may not equal the difference between “good” and “excellent” health.\nInterval Scale: Equal intervals between values but no true zero point. Example: Temperature in Celsius—the difference between 20°C and 30°C equals the difference between 30°C and 40°C, but 0°C doesn’t mean “no temperature.”\nRatio Scale: Equal intervals with a true zero point, allowing all mathematical operations. Example: Income—$40,000 is twice as much as $20,000, and $0 means no income.",

Understanding the relationships between these terms is essential for proper statistical reasoning.\n\nParameter\nA parameter is a numerical characteristic of a population. Parameters are typically unknown because we cannot measure the entire population. They are fixed values (not random) but unknown to us. We denote parameters with Greek letters.\nCommon Demographic Parameters:\n\n\\mu (mu): Population mean age. For example, the true average age of all Europeans.\n\\sigma^2 (sigma squared): Population variance in income across all households in Brazil.\np: Population proportion. For example, the true proportion of all adults in Japan who are married.\n\\beta (beta): Regression coefficient. The true relationship between education and fertility in a population.\n\\lambda (lambda): Rate parameter. The true rate of migration from rural to urban areas.\n\nExample: The true mean age at first birth for all women in France who gave birth in 2023 is a parameter. Let’s call it \\mu = 31.2 years. We don’t know this value without measuring every single birth.\n\n\nStatistic\nA statistic is a numerical characteristic calculated from sample data. Statistics are random variables—their values vary from sample to sample. We use Roman letters for statistics.\nCommon Sample Statistics:\n\n\\bar{x} (x-bar): Sample mean age from a survey of 1,000 people\ns^2: Sample variance in income from 500 surveyed households\n\\hat{p} (p-hat): Sample proportion married from a survey\nr: Sample correlation between education and income\nb: Sample regression coefficient\n\nExample: From a sample of 500 births in France, we calculate a sample mean age at first birth of \\bar{x} = 30.9 years. This is our statistic. A different sample might yield \\bar{x} = 31.4 years.\n\n\nThe Relationship Between Parameters and Statistics\nThink of this relationship like trying to understand the depth of a lake:\n\nParameter: The true average depth of the lake (unknown, fixed)\nStatistic: The average depth from several measurement points (known, varies with different samples)\nEstimation: Using our measurements to guess the true average depth\n\n\n\nEstimator\nAn estimator is a rule or formula for calculating an estimate of a population parameter from sample data. An estimator is a function that maps sample data to parameter estimates. It’s the recipe, not the cake.\nProperties of Good Estimators:\nUnbiasedness: On average, the estimator equals the true parameter value. If we repeated sampling many times, the average of all our estimates would equal the true parameter.\nExample: The sample mean \\bar{x} is an unbiased estimator of population mean \\mu. If we took 1,000 different samples and calculated 1,000 sample means, their average would be very close to \\mu.\nConsistency: As sample size increases, the estimator converges to the true parameter value.\nExample: With n=10, our estimate of average income might be off by $5,000. With n=1,000, we might be off by only $500. With n=100,000, we might be off by only $50.\nEfficiency: Among unbiased estimators, the one with the smallest variance. The sample mean is more efficient than the sample median for estimating the population mean of a normal distribution.\nCommon Estimators:\n\nSample mean as estimator of population mean: \\bar{x} = \\frac{\\sum x_i}{n}\nSample proportion as estimator of population proportion: \\hat{p} = \\frac{x}{n} (where x is the count of successes)\nSample variance as estimator of population variance: s^2 = \\frac{\\sum(x_i - \\bar{x})^2}{n-1}\n\nNote: We divide by (n-1) not n for sample variance to make it unbiased—this is called Bessel’s correction.\n\n\nEstimand\nThe estimand is the specific population parameter we aim to estimate. It’s the target of our estimation procedure. Clear specification of the estimand is crucial for proper statistical inference and avoiding misinterpretation.\nExamples of Clearly Defined Estimands:\n\n“The median household income for all households in California as of January 1, 2024”\n“The difference in life expectancy between males and females born in Sweden in 2023”\n“The proportion of all adults aged 25-34 in urban areas who completed tertiary education”\n\nWhy Precise Estimand Definition Matters:\nConsider studying “unemployment rate.” The estimand must specify:\n\nWho counts as unemployed? (Actively seeking work? Discouraged workers?)\nWhat age range? (15+? 16-64?)\nWhat geographic area?\nWhat time period?\n\nDifferent definitions lead to different numbers. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics publishes six different unemployment rates (U-1 through U-6) based on different definitions.\n\n\nEstimate\nAn estimate is the specific numerical value calculated by applying an estimator to observed data. It’s our best guess at the true parameter value based on available information.\nExample of the Complete Process:\n\nEstimand (target): The proportion of all U.S. adults who approve of the president’s performance\nParameter (true unknown value): p = 0.42 (42%, but we don’t know this)\nEstimator (method): Sample proportion \\hat{p} = \\frac{x}{n} where x is approvals and n is sample size\nSample: Survey 1,500 randomly selected adults, 650 approve\nEstimate (calculated value): \\hat{p} = \\frac{650}{1,500} = 0.433 (43.3%)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEstimands: What Exactly Are We Trying to Estimate?\n\n\n\nAn estimand is the specific quantity we aim to estimate—what we’re targeting with our statistical analysis. While this is often a population parameter, estimands can be more complex.\nExamples of different estimands:\nSimple parameter estimand: The population mean income (\\mu)\nComparative estimand: The difference in mean income between two groups (\\mu_1 - \\mu_2)\nCausal estimand: The average treatment effect of a job training program on earnings\nConditional estimand: Expected voter turnout given specific weather conditions\n\nThe Complete Framework\nUnderstanding statistical inference requires distinguishing between these related but distinct concepts:\n\nPopulation Parameter: The true characteristic of the population (e.g., \\mu)\nEstimand: The specific quantity we want to estimate (often, but not always, a parameter)\nEstimator: The method for computing our estimate (e.g., sample mean)\n\nEstimate: The actual number we calculate from our data\n\nExample in context:\n\nParameter: True mean voter turnout in all elections (\\mu)\nEstimand: Expected turnout difference between rainy vs. sunny election days (\\mu_{\\text{rainy}} - \\mu_{\\text{sunny}})\nEstimator: Difference between sample means from rainy and sunny elections\nEstimate: 3.2 percentage points lower turnout on rainy days\n\nThis framework helps clarify exactly what question we’re answering and ensures our methods align with our research goals.",

    "text": "1.7 Statistical Error and Uncertainty\n\nIntroduction: Why Uncertainty Matters\nNo measurement or estimate is perfect. Understanding different types of error is crucial for interpreting results and improving study design.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Central Challenge\n\n\n\nEvery time we use a sample to learn about a population, we introduce uncertainty. The key is to:\n\nQuantify this uncertainty honestly\nDistinguish between different sources of error\nCommunicate results transparently\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTypes of Error\n\nRandom Error (Sampling Error)\nRandom error arises from natural variability in sampling—the unavoidable variation that occurs because we observe a sample rather than the entire population.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Characteristics\n\n\n\n\nUnpredictable Direction: Sometimes too high, sometimes too low\nDecreases with Sample Size: \\propto 1/\\sqrt{n}\nQuantifiable: Calculable using probability theory\nAverages to Zero: Over many samples, errors cancel out\n\n\n\n\nExample: Internet Access Survey\nImagine surveying 100 random households about internet access:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe variation around the true value (red line) represents random error. With larger samples, estimates would cluster more tightly.\n\n\n\nSystematic Error (Bias)\nSystematic error represents consistent deviation in a particular direction. Unlike random error, it doesn’t average out with repeated sampling.\n\nSelection BiasMeasurement BiasResponse BiasNon-response BiasSurvivorship Bias\n\n\nSampling method systematically excludes certain groups.\nExample: Phone surveys during business hours underrepresent employed people.\n\n\nMeasurement instrument consistently over/under-measures.\nExample: Scales that always read 2 pounds heavy.\n\n\nRespondents systematically misreport.\nExample: People underreport alcohol consumption, overreport voting.\n\n\nNon-responders differ systematically from responders.\nExample: Very sick and very healthy people less likely to respond to health surveys.\n\n\nOnly observing “survivors” of some process.\nExample: Studying longevity by interviewing 90-year-olds misses those who died younger.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Bias-Variance Decomposition\nMathematically, total error (Mean Squared Error) decomposes into:\n\\mathrm{MSE}(\\hat\\theta) = \\underbrace{\\mathrm{Var}(\\hat\\theta)}_{\\text{random error}} + \\underbrace{\\big(\\mathrm{Bias}(\\hat\\theta)\\big)^2}_{\\text{systematic error}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCritical Insight\n\n\n\nA large biased sample gives a precisely wrong answer.\n\nIncrease n → reduces random error\nImprove design → reduces systematic error\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDifferent combinations of bias and variance in estimation\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuantifying Uncertainty\n\nStandard Error\nThe standard error (SE) quantifies how much an estimate varies across different possible samples.\n\n\nFor a Proportion: SE(\\hat{p}) = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat{p}(1-\\hat{p})}{n}}\nFor a Mean: SE(\\bar{x}) = \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{n}}\n\nFor a Difference: SE(\\bar{x}_1 - \\bar{x}_2) = \\sqrt{\\frac{s_1^2}{n_1} + \\frac{s_2^2}{n_2}}\n\n\n\n\nMargin of Error\nThe margin of error (MOE) represents the expected maximum difference between sample estimate and true parameter.\n\\text{MOE} = \\text{Critical Value} \\times \\text{Standard Error}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnderstanding the Critical Value\n\n\n\n\n\nFor 95% confidence, we use 1.96 (often simplified to 2).

    "text": "1.8 Sampling and Sampling Methods\nSampling is the process of selecting a subset of individuals from a population to estimate characteristics of the whole population. The way we sample profoundly affects what we can conclude from our data.\n\nThe Sampling Frame\nBefore discussing methods, we must understand the sampling frame—the list or device from which we draw our sample. The frame should ideally include every population member exactly once.\nCommon Sampling Frames:\n\nElectoral rolls (for adult citizens)\nTelephone directories (increasingly problematic due to mobile phones and unlisted numbers)\nAddress lists from postal services\nBirth registrations (for newborns)\nSchool enrollment lists (for children)\nTax records (for income earners)\nSatellite imagery (for dwellings in remote areas)\n\nFrame Problems:\n\nUndercoverage: Frame missing population members (homeless individuals not on address lists)\nOvercoverage: Frame includes non-population members (deceased people still on voter rolls)\nDuplication: Same unit appears multiple times (people with multiple phone numbers)\nClustering: Multiple population members per frame unit (multiple families at one address)\n\n\n\nProbability Sampling Methods\nProbability sampling gives every population member a known, non-zero probability of selection. This allows us to make statistical inferences about the population.\n\nSimple Random Sampling (SRS)\nEvery possible sample of size n has equal probability of selection. It’s the gold standard for statistical theory but often impractical for large populations.\nHow It Works:\n\nNumber every unit in the population from 1 to N\nUse random numbers to select n units\nEach unit has probability n/N of selection\n\nExample: To sample 50 students from a school of 1,000:\n\nAssign each student a number from 1 to 1,000\nGenerate 50 random numbers between 1 and 1,000\nSelect students with those numbers\n\nAdvantages:\n\nStatistically optimal\nEasy to analyze\nNo need for additional information about population\n\nDisadvantages:\n\nRequires complete sampling frame\nCan be expensive (selected units might be far apart)\nMay not represent important subgroups well by chance\n\n\n\nSystematic Sampling\nSelect every kth element from an ordered sampling frame, where k = N/n (the sampling interval).\nHow It Works:\n\nCalculate sampling interval k = N/n\nRandomly select starting point between 1 and k\nSelect every kth unit thereafter\n\nExample: To sample 100 houses from 5,000 on a street listing:\n\nk = 5,000/100 = 50\nRandom start: 23\nSample houses: 23, 73, 123, 173, 223…\n\nAdvantages:\n\nSimple to implement in field\nSpreads sample throughout population\n\nDisadvantages:\n\nCan introduce bias if there’s periodicity in the frame\n\nHidden Periodicity Example: Sampling every 10th apartment in buildings where corner apartments (numbers ending in 0) are all larger. This would bias our estimate of average apartment size.\n\n\nStratified Sampling\nDivide population into homogeneous subgroups (strata) before sampling. Sample independently within each stratum.\nHow It Works:\n\nDivide population into non-overlapping strata\nSample independently from each stratum\nCombine results with appropriate weights\n\nExample: Studying income in a city with distinct neighborhoods:\n\nStratum 1: High-income neighborhood (10% of population) - sample 100\nStratum 2: Middle-income neighborhood (60% of population) - sample 600\nStratum 3: Low-income neighborhood (30% of population) - sample 300\n\nTypes of Allocation:\nProportional: Sample size in each stratum proportional to stratum size\n\nIf stratum has 20% of population, it gets 20% of sample\n\nOptimal (Neyman): Larger samples from more variable strata\n\nIf income varies more in high-income areas, sample more there\n\nEqual: Same sample size per stratum regardless of population size\n\nUseful when comparing strata is primary goal\n\nAdvantages:\n\nEnsures representation of all subgroups\nCan increase precision substantially\nAllows different sampling methods per stratum\nProvides estimates for each stratum\n\nDisadvantages:\n\nRequires information to create strata\nCan be complex to analyze\n\n\n\nCluster Sampling\nSelect groups (clusters) rather than individuals. Often used when population is naturally grouped or when creating a complete frame is difficult.\nSingle-Stage Cluster Sampling:\n\nDivide population into clusters\nRandomly select some clusters\nInclude all units from selected clusters\n\nTwo-Stage Cluster Sampling:\n\nRandomly select clusters (Primary Sampling Units)\nWithin selected clusters, randomly select individuals (Secondary Sampling Units)\n\nExample: Surveying rural households in a large country:\n\nStage 1: Randomly select 50 villages from 1,000 villages\nStage 2: Within each selected village, randomly select 20 households\nTotal sample: 50 × 20 = 1,000 households\n\nMulti-Stage Example: National health survey:\n\nStage 1: Select states\nStage 2: Select counties within selected states\nStage 3: Select census blocks within selected counties\nStage 4: Select households within selected blocks\nStage 5: Select one adult within selected households\n\nAdvantages:\n\nDoesn’t require complete population list\nReduces travel costs (units clustered geographically)\nCan use different methods at different stages\nNatural for hierarchical populations\n\nDisadvantages:\n\nLess statistically efficient than SRS\nComplex variance estimation\nLarger samples needed for same precision\n\nDesign Effect: Cluster sampling typically requires larger samples than SRS. The design effect (DEFF) quantifies this:\n\\text{DEFF} = \\frac{\\text{Variance(cluster sample)}}{\\text{Variance(SRS)}}\nIf DEFF = 2, you need twice the sample size to achieve the same precision as SRS.\n\n\n\nNon-Probability Sampling Methods\nNon-probability sampling doesn’t guarantee known selection probabilities. While limiting statistical inference, these methods may be necessary or useful in certain situations.\n\nConvenience Sampling\nSelection based purely on ease of access. No attempt at representation.\nExamples:\n\nSurveying students in your class about study habits\nInterviewing people at a shopping mall about consumer preferences\nOnline polls where anyone can participate\nMedical studies using volunteers who respond to advertisements\n\nWhen It Might Be Acceptable:\n\nPilot studies to test survey instruments\nExploratory research to identify issues\nWhen studying processes believed to be universal\n\nMajor Problems:\n\nNo basis for inference to population\nSevere selection bias likely\nResults may be completely misleading\n\nReal Example: Literary Digest’s 1936 U.S. presidential poll surveyed 2.4 million people (huge sample!) but used telephone directories and club memberships as frames during the Depression, dramatically overrepresenting wealthy voters and incorrectly predicting Landon would defeat Roosevelt.\n\n\nPurposive (Judgmental) Sampling\nDeliberate selection of specific cases based on researcher judgment about what’s “typical” or “interesting.”\nExamples:\n\nSelecting “typical” villages to represent rural areas\nChoosing specific age groups for a developmental study\nSelecting extreme cases to understand range of variation\nPicking information-rich cases for in-depth study\n\nTypes of Purposive Sampling:\nTypical Case: Choose average or normal examples\n\nStudying “typical” American suburbs\n\nExtreme/Deviant Case: Choose unusual examples\n\nStudying villages with unusually low infant mortality to understand success factors\n\nMaximum Variation: Deliberately pick diverse cases\n\nSelecting diverse schools (urban/rural, rich/poor, large/small) for education research\n\nCritical Case: Choose cases that will be definitive\n\n“If it doesn’t work here, it won’t work anywhere”\n\nWhen It’s Useful:\n\nQualitative research focusing on depth over breadth\nWhen studying rare populations\nResource constraints limit sample size severely\nExploratory phases of research\n\nProblems:\n\nEntirely dependent on researcher judgment\nNo statistical inference possible\nDifferent researchers might select different “typical” cases\n\n\n\nQuota Sampling\nSelection to match population proportions on key characteristics. Like stratified sampling but without random selection within groups.\nHow Quota Sampling Works:\n\nIdentify key characteristics (age, sex, race, education)\nDetermine population proportions for these characteristics\nSet quotas for each combination\nInterviewers fill quotas using convenience methods\n\nDetailed Example: Political poll with quotas:\nPopulation proportions:\n\nMale 18-34: 15%\nMale 35-54: 20%\nMale 55+: 15%\nFemale 18-34: 16%\nFemale 35-54: 19%\nFemale 55+: 15%\n\nFor a sample of 1,000:\n\nInterview 150 males aged 18-34\nInterview 200 males aged 35-54\nAnd so on…\n\nInterviewers might stand on street corners approaching people who appear to fit needed categories until quotas are filled.\nWhy It’s Popular in Market Research:\n\nFaster than probability sampling\nCheaper (no callbacks for specific individuals)\nEnsures demographic representation\nNo sampling frame needed\n\nWhy It’s Problematic for Statistical Inference:\nHidden Selection Bias: Interviewers approach people who look approachable, speak the language well, aren’t in a hurry—systematically excluding certain types within each quota cell.\nExample of Bias: An interviewer filling a quota for “women 18-34” might approach women at a shopping mall on Tuesday afternoon, systematically missing:\n\nWomen who work during weekdays\nWomen who can’t afford to shop at malls\nWomen with young children who avoid malls\nWomen who shop online\n\nEven though the final sample has the “right” proportion of young women, they’re not representative of all young women.\nNo Measure of Sampling Error: Without selection probabilities, we can’t calculate standard errors or confidence intervals.\nHistorical Cautionary Tale: Quota sampling was standard in polling until the 1948 U.S. presidential election, when polls using quota sampling incorrectly predicted Dewey would defeat Truman. The failure led to adoption of probability sampling in polling.\n\n\nSnowball Sampling\nParticipants recruit additional subjects from their acquaintances. The sample grows like a rolling snowball.\nHow It Works:\n\nIdentify initial participants (seeds)\nAsk them to refer others with required characteristics\nAsk new participants for further referrals\nContinue until sample size reached or referrals exhausted\n\nExample: Studying undocumented immigrants:\n\nStart with 5 immigrants you can identify\nEach refers 3 others they know\nThose 15 each refer 2-3 others\nContinue until you have 100+ participants\n\nWhen It’s Valuable:\nHidden Populations: Groups without sampling frames\n\nDrug users\nHomeless individuals\nPeople with rare diseases\nMembers of underground movements\n\nSocially Connected Populations: When relationships matter\n\nStudying social network effects\nResearching community transmission of diseases\nUnderstanding information diffusion\n\nTrust-Dependent Research: When referrals increase participation\n\nSensitive topics where trust is essential\nClosed communities suspicious of outsiders\n\nMajor Limitations:\n\nSamples biased toward cooperative, well-connected individuals\nIsolated members of population missed entirely\nStatistical inference generally impossible\nCan reinforce social divisions (chains rarely cross social boundaries)\n\nAdvanced Version - Respondent-Driven Sampling (RDS):\nAttempts to make snowball sampling more rigorous by:\n\nTracking who recruited whom\nLimiting number of referrals per person\nWeighting based on network size\nUsing mathematical models to adjust for bias\n\nStill controversial whether RDS truly allows valid inference.",

    "text": "1.9 Probability Concepts for Statistical Analysis\nWhile this is primarily a statistics course, understanding basic probability is essential for statistical inference.\n\nBasic Probability\nProbability quantifies uncertainty on a scale from 0 (impossible) to 1 (certain).\nClassical Probability: P(\\text{event}) = \\frac{\\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\\text{Total possible outcomes}}\nExample: Probability a randomly selected person is female \\approx 0.5\nEmpirical Probability: Based on observed frequencies\nExample: In a village, 423 of 1,000 residents are female, so P(\\text{female}) \\approx 0.423\n\n\nConditional Probability\nConditional Probability is the probability of event A given that event B has occurred: P(A|B)\nDemographic Example: Probability of dying within a year given current age:\n\nP(\\text{death within year} | \\text{age 30}) \\approx 0.001\nP(\\text{death within year} | \\text{age 80}) \\approx 0.05\n\nThese conditional probabilities form the basis of life tables.\n\n\nIndependence\nEvents A and B are independent if P(A|B) = P(A).\nTesting Independence in Demographic Data:\nAre education and fertility independent?\n\nP(\\text{3+ children}) = 0.3 overall\nP(\\text{3+ children} | \\text{college degree}) = 0.15\nDifferent probabilities indicate dependence\n\n\n\nLaw of Large Numbers\nAs sample size increases, sample statistics converge to population parameters.\nDemonstration: Estimating sex ratio at birth:\n\n10 births: 7 males (70% - very unstable)\n100 births: 53 males (53% - getting closer to ~51.2%)\n1,000 births: 515 males (51.5% - quite close)\n10,000 births: 5,118 males (51.18% - very close)\n\n\n\nVisualizing the Law of Large Numbers: Coin Flips\nLet’s see this in action with coin flips. A fair coin has a 50% chance of landing heads, but individual flips are unpredictable.\n\n# Simulate coin flips and show convergence\nset.seed(42)\nn_flips &lt;- 1000\nflips &lt;- rbinom(n_flips, 1, 0.5)  # 1 = heads, 0 = tails\n\n# Calculate cumulative proportion of heads\ncumulative_prop &lt;- cumsum(flips) / seq_along(flips)\n\n# Create data frame for plotting\nlln_data &lt;- data.frame(\n  flip_number = 1:n_flips,\n  cumulative_proportion = cumulative_prop\n)\n\n# Plot the convergence\nggplot(lln_data, aes(x = flip_number, y = cumulative_proportion)) +\n  geom_line(color = \"steelblue\", alpha = 0.7) +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 0.5, color = \"red\", linetype = \"dashed\", size = 1) +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = c(0.45, 0.55), color = \"red\", linetype = \"dotted\", alpha = 0.7) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Law of Large Numbers: Coin Flip Proportions Converge to 0.5\",\n    x = \"Number of coin flips\",\n    y = \"Cumulative proportion of heads\",\n    caption = \"Red dashed line = true probability (0.5)\\nDotted lines = ±5% range\"\n  ) +\n  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0.3, 0.7), breaks = seq(0.3, 0.7, 0.1)) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat this shows:\n\nEarly flips show wild variation (first 10 flips might be 70% or 30% heads)\nAs we add more flips, the proportion stabilizes around 50%\nThe “noise” of individual outcomes averages out over time\n\n\n\nThe Mathematical Statement\nLet A denote an event of interest (e.g., “heads on a coin flip”, “vote for party X”, “sum of dice equals 7”). If P(A) = p and we observe n independent trials with the same distribution (i.i.d.), then the sample frequency of A:\n\\hat{p}_n = \\frac{\\text{number of occurrences of } A}{n}\nconverges to p as n increases.\n\n\nExamples in Different Contexts\nDice example: The event “sum = 7” with two dice has probability 6/36 ≈ 16.7\\%, while “sum = 4” has 3/36 ≈ 8.3\\%. Over many throws, a sum of 7 appears about twice as often as a sum of 4.\nElection polling: If population support for a party equals p, then under random sampling of size n, the observed frequency \\hat{p}_n will approach p as n grows (assuming random sampling and independence).\nQuality control: If 2% of products are defective, then in large batches, approximately 2% will be found defective (assuming independent production).\n\n\nWhy This Matters for Statistics\nBottom line: Randomness underpins statistical inference by turning uncertainty in individual outcomes into predictable distributions for estimates. The Law of Large Numbers guarantees that the “noise” of individual outcomes averages out, allowing us to:\n\nPredict long-run frequencies\nQuantify uncertainty (margins of error)\n\nDraw reliable inferences from samples\nMake probabilistic statements about populations\n\nThis principle works in surveys, experiments, and even quantum phenomena (in the frequentist interpretation).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is randomness? (*)\n\n\n\nIn statistics, randomness is an orderly way to describe uncertainty: individual outcomes are unpredictable, yet in long sequences of repetitions stable regularities emerge (e.g., frequencies, means).\nTwo perspectives\n\nSingle realisation — we cannot determine how a specific voter will vote at a given moment.\n\nAggregate — we can describe the share of voters supporting a party and quantify the associated estimation uncertainty.\n\nEpistemic vs. ontological randomness\n\nEpistemic (due to incomplete knowledge): we treat an outcome as random because not all determinants are observed or conditions are not controlled.\nExamples:\n\nthe decision of an individual respondent in a poll (we do not know the full set of motivations),\nmeasurement error in a survey (limited precision, item nonresponse),\na coin toss modeled as random because minute, unobserved differences in initial conditions determine the outcome.\n\nOntological (intrinsic indeterminacy): even complete knowledge does not remove outcome uncertainty.\nExamples:\n\nthe time to radioactive decay of an atom.\n\n\n\nWhy Randomness Matters\n\nRandom sampling\n\nReduces systematic selection bias so the sample resembles the target population (in expectation).\nMakes uncertainty quantifiable (e.g., margins of error; later we’ll name these “confidence intervals”), assuming genuinely random selection and good coverage.\n\nRandom assignment (experiments)\n\nBreaks the link between treatment and other factors, making groups comparable on average (both observed and unobserved).\nSupports credible cause-and-effect claims (identifies average treatment effects under standard conditions).\n\n\n\n\nThe Power of Random Sampling\nSuppose we take a random sample of n=1000 voters and observe \\hat p = 0.55 (i.e., 55% support). Then:\n\nOur best single-number estimate of the population share is \\hat p = 0.55.\nA typical “95\\% range of plausible values” around \\hat p can be approximated by \n\\hat p \\;\\pm\\; 2\\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat p(1-\\hat p)}{n}}\n\\;=\\;\n0.55 \\;\\pm\\; 2\\sqrt{\\frac{0.55\\cdot 0.45}{1000}}\n\\approx\n0.55 \\pm 0.031,\n i.e., roughly 52\\%\\text{–}58\\% (about \\pm 3.1 percentage points).\nThe width of this range shrinks predictably with sample size: \n\\text{width} \\;\\propto\\; \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}}.\n For example, increasing n from 1000 to 4000 cuts the range by about half.\n\n\n\n1.10 Understanding Different Types of Unpredictability\nNot all uncertainty is the same. Understanding different sources of unpredictability helps us choose appropriate statistical methods and interpret results correctly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConcept\nWhat is it?\nSource of unpredictability\nExample\n\n\n\n\nRandomness\nIndividual outcomes are uncertain, but the probability distribution is known or modeled.\nFluctuations across realizations; lack of information about a specific outcome.\nDice roll, coin toss, polling sample\n\n\nChaos\nDeterministic dynamics highly sensitive to initial conditions (butterfly effect).\nTiny initial differences grow rapidly → large trajectory divergences.\nWeather forecasting, double pendulum, population dynamics\n\n\nEntropy\nA measure of uncertainty/dispersion (information-theoretic or thermodynamic).\nLarger when outcomes are more evenly distributed (less predictive information).\nShannon entropy in data compression\n\n\n“Haphazardness” (colloquial)\nA felt lack of order without an explicit model; a mixture of mechanisms.\nNo structured description or stable rules; overlapping processes.\nTraffic patterns, social media trends\n\n\nQuantum randomness\nA single outcome is not determined; only the distribution is specified (Born rule).\nFundamental (ontological) indeterminacy of individual measurements.\nElectron spin measurement, photon polarization\n\n\n\n\nKey Distinctions for Statistical Practice\nDeterministic chaos ≠ statistical randomness: A chaotic system is fully deterministic yet practically unpredictable due to extreme sensitivity to initial conditions.

    "text": "1.11 Statistical Significance: A Quick Start Guide\nImagine you flip a coin 10 times and get 8 heads. Is the coin biased, or did you just get lucky? This is the core question statistical significance (statistical inference) helps us answer.\nStatistical significance tells us whether patterns in our data likely reflect something real or could have happened by pure chance.\nStatistical significance is a measure (p-value) of how confident we can be that patterns observed in our sample are not due to chance alone. When a result is statistically significant (typically p-value &lt; 0.05), it means the probability of obtaining such data in the absence of a real effect is very low.\n\nThe Courtroom Analogy\nStatistical hypothesis testing works like a criminal trial:\n\nNull Hypothesis (H_0): The defendant is innocent (no effect exists)\nAlternative Hypothesis (H_1): The defendant is guilty (an effect exists)\nThe Evidence: Your data and test results\nThe Verdict: “Guilty” (reject H_0) or “Not Guilty” (fail to reject H_0)\n\nCrucial distinction: “Not guilty” ≠ “Innocent”\n\nA “not guilty” verdict means insufficient evidence to convict\nSimilarly, “not statistically significant” means insufficient evidence for an effect, NOT proof of no effect\n\n\n\nStart with Skepticism (Presumption of Innocence)\nIn statistics, we always start by assuming nothing special is happening:\n\nNull Hypothesis (H_0): “There’s no effect”\n\nThe coin is fair\nThe new drug doesn’t work\nStudy time doesn’t affect grades\n\nAlternative Hypothesis (H_1): “There IS an effect”\n\nThe coin is biased\nThe drug works\nMore study time improves grades\n\n\nKey principle: We maintain the null hypothesis (innocence) unless our data provides strong evidence against it—“beyond a reasonable doubt” in legal terms, or “p &lt; 0.05” in statistical terms.",

We found his DNA. Therefore, there’s a 99% chance he’s guilty!”\nThis is WRONG! The prosecutor confused:\n\nP(Evidence | Innocent) = 0.01 ← What we know\nP(Innocent | Evidence) = ? ← What we want to know (but can’t get from the p-value alone!)\n\n\nWhen we get p = 0.01, it’s tempting to think:\n❌ WRONG: “There’s only a 1% chance the null hypothesis is true”\n❌ WRONG: “There’s a 99% chance our treatment works”\n✅ CORRECT: “If the null hypothesis were true, there’s only a 1% chance we’d see data this extreme”\n\n\nWhy This Matters: A Simple Medical Testing Example\nImagine a rare disease test that’s 99% accurate:\n\nIf you have the disease, the test is positive 99% of the time\nIf you don’t have the disease, the test is negative 99% of the time (so 1% false positive rate)\n\nHere’s the key: Suppose only 1 in 1000 people actually have this disease.\nNow let’s test 10,000 people:\n\n10 people have the disease → 10 test positive (rounded)\n9,990 people don’t have the disease → about 100 test positive by mistake (1% of 9,990)\nTotal positive tests: 110\n\nIf you test positive, what’s the chance you actually have the disease?\n\nOnly 10 out of 110 positive tests are real\nThat’s about 9%, not 99%!\n\n\n\nThe Research Analogy\nThe same thing happens in research:\n\nWhen we test many hypotheses (like testing many potential drugs)\nMost don’t work (like most people don’t have the rare disease)\nEven with “significant” results (like a positive test), most findings might be false positives\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nA p-value tells you how surprising your data would be IF the null hypothesis were true. It doesn’t tell you the probability that the null hypothesis IS true.\nThink of it like this: The probability of the ground being wet IF it rained is very different from the probability it rained IF the ground is wet—the ground could be wet from a sprinkler!\n\nRemember: A p-value tells you P(Data | Null is true), not P(Null is true | Data). These are as different as P(Wet ground | Rain) and P(Rain | Wet ground)—the ground could be wet from a sprinkler!",

    "section": "1.15 Introduction to Regression Analysis: Modeling Relationships Between Variables",
    "text": "1.15 Introduction to Regression Analysis: Modeling Relationships Between Variables\nOne of the most powerful tools in statistical analysis is regression analysis—a method for understanding and quantifying relationships between variables.\nThe core idea is simple: How does one thing relate to another, and can we use that relationship to make predictions?\n\nThe One-Sentence Summary: Regression helps us understand how things relate to each other in a messy, complicated world where everything affects everything else.\n\n\nWhat is Regression Analysis?\nImagine you’re curious about the relationship between education and income. You notice that people with more education tend to earn more money, but you want to understand this relationship more precisely:\n\nHow much does each additional year of education increase income, on average?\nHow strong is this relationship?\nAre there other factors we should consider?\nCan we predict someone’s likely income if we know their education level?\n\nRegression analysis provides systematic answers to these questions. It’s like finding the “best-fitting story” that describes how variables relate to each other.\n\n\nVariables and Variation\nA variable is any characteristic that can take different values across units of observation. In political science:\n\nUnits of analysis: Countries, individuals, elections, policies, years\nVariables: GDP, voting preference, democracy score, conflict occurrence\n\n\n💡 In Plain English: A variable is anything that changes. If everyone voted the same way, “voting preference” wouldn’t be a variable—it would be a constant. We study variables because we want to understand why things differ.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nConsider a typical pre-election news headline: “Candidate Smith’s approval rating reaches 68%.” Your immediate inference likely suggests favorable electoral prospects for Smith—not guaranteed victory, but a strong position. You naturally understand that higher approval ratings tend to predict better electoral performance, even though the relationship is not perfect.\nThis intuitive assessment exemplifies the core logic of regression analysis. You used one piece of information (approval rating) to make a prediction about another outcome (electoral success). Moreover, you recognized both the relationship between these variables and the uncertainty inherent in your prediction.\nWhile such informal reasoning serves us well in daily life, it has important limitations. How much better are Smith’s chances at 68% approval compared to 58%? What happens when we need to consider multiple factors simultaneously—approval ratings, economic conditions, and incumbency status? How confident should we be in our predictions?\nRegression analysis provides a systematic framework for addressing these questions. It transforms our intuitive understanding of relationships into precise mathematical models that can be tested and refined. Through regression analysis, researchers can:\n\nGenerate precise predictions: Move beyond general assessments to specific numerical estimates—for instance, predicting not just that Smith will “probably win,” but estimating the expected vote share and range of likely outcomes.\nIdentify which factors matter most: Determine the relative importance of different variables—perhaps discovering that economic conditions influence elections more strongly than approval ratings.\nQuantify uncertainty in predictions: Explicitly measure how confident we should be in our predictions, distinguishing between near-certain outcomes and educated guesses.\nTest theoretical propositions with empirical data: Evaluate whether our beliefs about cause-and-effect relationships hold up when examined systematically across many observations.\n\n\nIn essence, regression analysis systematizes the pattern recognition we perform intuitively, providing tools to make our predictions more accurate, our comparisons more meaningful, and our conclusions more reliable.\n\n\n\nThe Fundamental Model\nA model represents an object, person, or system in an informative way. Models divide into physical representations (such as architectural models) and abstract representations (such as mathematical equations describing atmospheric dynamics).\nThe core of statistical thinking can be expressed as:\nY = f(X) + \\text{error}\nThis equation states that our outcome (Y) equals some function of our predictors (X), plus unpredictable variation.\nComponents:\n\nY = Dependent variable (the phenomenon we seek to explain)\nX = Independent variable(s) (explanatory factors)\nf() = The functional relationship (often assumed linear)\nerror (\\epsilon) = Unexplained variation\n\n\n💡 What This Really Means: Think of it like a recipe. Your grade in a class (Y) depends on study hours (X), but not perfectly. Two students studying 10 hours might get different grades because of test anxiety, prior knowledge, or just luck (the error term). Regression finds the average relationship.\n\nThis model provides the foundation for all statistical analysis—from simple correlations to complex machine learning algorithms.\nRegression helps answer fundamental questions such as:\n\nHow much does education increase political participation?\nWhat factors predict electoral success?\nDo democratic institutions promote economic growth?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Basic Idea: Drawing the Best Line Through Points\n\nSimple Linear Regression\nLet’s start with the simplest case: the relationship between two variables. Suppose we plot education (years of schooling) on the x-axis and annual income on the y-axis for 100 people. We’d see a cloud of points, and regression finds the straight line that best represents the pattern in these points.\nWhat makes a line “best”? The regression line minimizes the total squared vertical distances from all points to the line. Think of it as finding the line that makes the smallest total prediction error.\nThe equation of this line is: Y = a + bX + \\text{error}\nOr in our example: \\text{Income} = a + b \\times \\text{Education} + \\text{error}\nWhere:\n\na (intercept) = predicted income with zero education\nb (slope) = change in income per additional year of education\nerror (e) = difference between actual and predicted income\n\nInterpreting the Results:\nIf our analysis finds: \\text{Income} = 15,000 + 4,000 \\times \\text{Education}\nThis tells us:\n\nSomeone with 0 years of education is predicted to earn $15,000\nEach additional year of education is associated with $4,000 more income\nSomeone with 12 years of education is predicted to earn: $15,000 + (4,000 ) = $63,000\nSomeone with 16 years (bachelor’s degree) is predicted to earn: $15,000 + (4,000 ) = $79,000\n\n\n\n\nUnderstanding Relationships vs. Proving Causation\nA crucial distinction: regression shows association, not necessarily causation. Our education-income regression shows they’re related, but doesn’t prove education causes higher income. Other explanations are possible:\n\nReverse causation: Maybe wealthier families can afford more education for their children\nCommon cause: Perhaps intelligence or motivation affects both education and income\nCoincidence: In small samples, patterns can appear by chance\n\nExample of Spurious Correlation: A regression might show that ice cream sales strongly predict drowning deaths. Does ice cream cause drowning? No! Both increase in summer (the common cause, confounding variable).\n\n\n\nMultiple Regression: Controlling for Other Factors\nReal life is complicated—many factors influence outcomes simultaneously. Multiple regression lets us examine one relationship while “controlling for” or “holding constant” other variables.\n\nThe Power of Statistical Control\nReturning to education and income, we might wonder: Is the education effect just because educated people tend to be from wealthier families, or live in cities? Multiple regression can separate these effects:\n\\text{Income} = a + b_1 \\times \\text{Education} + b_2 \\times \\text{Age} + b_3 \\times \\text{Urban} + b_4 \\times \\text{Parent Income} + \\text{error}\nNow b_1 represents the education effect after accounting for age, location, and family background. If b_1 = 3,000, it means: “Comparing people of the same age, location, and family background, each additional year of education is associated with $3,000 more income.”\nDemographic Example: Fertility and Women’s Education\nResearchers studying fertility might find: \\text{Children} = 4.5 - 0.3 \\times \\text{Education}\nThis suggests each year of women’s education is associated with 0.3 fewer children. But is education the cause, or are educated women different in other ways? Adding controls:\n\\text{Children} = a - 0.15 \\times \\text{Education} - 0.2 \\times \\text{Urban} + 0.1 \\times \\text{Husband Education} - 0.4 \\times \\text{Contraceptive Access}\nNow we see education’s association is weaker (-0.15 instead of -0.3) after accounting for urban residence and contraceptive access. This suggests part of education’s apparent effect operates through these other pathways.\n\n\n\nTypes of Variables in Regression\n\nOutcome (Dependent) Variable\nThis is what we’re trying to understand or predict:\n\nIncome in our first example\nNumber of children in our fertility example\nLife expectancy in health studies\nMigration probability in population studies\n\n\n\nPredictor (Independent) Variables\nThese are factors we think might influence the outcome:\n\nQuantitative: Age, years of education, income, distance\nQualitative (categorical): Gender, race, marital status, region\nBinary (Dummy): Urban/rural, employed/unemployed, married/unmarried\n\nHandling Categorical Variables: We can’t directly put “religion” into an equation. Instead, we create binary variables:\n\nChristian = 1 if Christian, 0 otherwise\nMuslim = 1 if Muslim, 0 otherwise\nHindu = 1 if Hindu, 0 otherwise\n(One category becomes the reference group)\n\n\n\n\nDifferent Types of Regression for Different Outcomes\nThe basic regression idea adapts to many situations:\n\nLinear Regression\nFor continuous outcomes (income, height, blood pressure): Y = a + b_1X_1 + b_2X_2 + … + \\text{error}\n\n\nLogistic Regression\nFor binary outcomes (died/survived, migrated/stayed, married/unmarried):\nInstead of predicting the outcome directly, we predict the probability: \\log\\left(\\frac{p}{1-p}\\right) = a + b_1X_1 + b_2X_2 + …\nWhere p is the probability of the event occurring.\nExample: Predicting migration probability based on age, education, and marital status. The model might find young, educated, unmarried people have 40% probability of migrating, while older, less educated, married people have only 5% probability.\n\n\nPoisson Regression\nFor count outcomes (number of children, number of doctor visits): \\log(\\text{expected count}) = a + b_1X_1 + b_2X_2 + …\nExample: Modeling number of children based on women’s characteristics. Useful because it ensures predictions are never negative (can’t have -0.5 children!).\n\n\nSurvival (Cox model)/Hazard Regression\nWhat it’s for: Predicting when something will happen, not just if it will happen.\nThe challenge: Imagine you’re studying how long marriages last. You follow 1,000 couples for 10 years, but by the end of your study:\n\n400 couples divorced (you know exactly when)\n600 couples are still married (you don’t know if/when they’ll divorce)\n\nRegular regression can’t handle this “incomplete story” problem—those 600 ongoing marriages contain valuable information, but we don’t know their endpoints yet.\nHow Cox models help: Instead of trying to predict the exact timing, they focus on relative risk—who’s more likely to experience the event sooner. Think of it like asking “At any given moment, who’s at higher risk?” rather than “Exactly when will this happen?”\nReal-world applications:\n\nMedical research: Who responds to treatment faster?\nBusiness: Which customers cancel subscriptions sooner?\nSocial science: What factors make life events happen earlier/later?\n\n\n\n\n\nInterpreting Regression Results\n\nCoefficients\nThe coefficient tells us the expected change in outcome for a one-unit increase in the predictor, holding other variables constant.\nExamples of Interpretation:\nLinear regression for income:\n\n“Each additional year of education is associated with $3,500 higher annual income, controlling for age and experience”\n\nLogistic regression for infant mortality:\n\n“Each additional prenatal visit is associated with 15% lower odds of infant death, controlling for mother’s age and education”\n\nMultiple regression for life expectancy:\n\n“Each $1,000 increase in per-capita GDP is associated with 0.4 years longer life expectancy, after controlling for education and healthcare access”\n\n\n\nStatistical Significance\nThe regression also tests whether relationships could be due to chance:\n\np-value &lt; 0.05: Relationship unlikely due to chance (statistically significant)\np-value &gt; 0.05: Relationship could plausibly be random variation\n\n\nBut remember: Statistical significance ≠ practical importance. With large samples, tiny effects become “significant.”\n\n\n\nConfidence Intervals for Coefficients\nJust as we have confidence intervals for means or proportions, we have them for regression coefficients:\n“The effect of education on income is $3,500 per year, 95% CI: [$2,800, $4,200]”\nThis means we’re 95% confident the true effect is between $2,800 and $4,200.\n\n\nR-squared: How Well Does the Model Fit?\nR^2 (R-squared) measures the proportion of variation in the outcome explained by the predictors:\n\nR^2 = 0: Predictors explain nothing\nR^2 = 1: Predictors explain everything\nR^2 = 0.3: Predictors explain 30% of variation\n\nExample: A model of income with only education might have R^2 = 0.15 (education explains 15% of income variation). Adding age, experience, and location might increase R^2 to 0.35 (together they explain 35%).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssumptions and Limitations\n\n\n\nRegression makes assumptions that may not hold:\n\nExogeneity (No Hidden Relationships)\nThe most fundamental assumption: predictors must not be correlated with errors. In simple terms, there shouldn’t be hidden factors that affect both your predictors and outcome.\nExample: If studying education’s effect on income but omitting “ability,” your results are biased - ability affects both education level and income. This assumption is written as: E[\\varepsilon | X] = 0\nWhy it matters: Without it, all your coefficients are wrong, even with millions of observations!\n\n\nLinearity\nAssumes straight-line relationships. But what if education’s effect on income is stronger at higher levels? We can add polynomial terms: \\text{Income} = a + b_1 \\times \\text{Education} + b_2 \\times \\text{Education}^2\n\n\nIndependence\nAssumes observations are independent. But family members might be similar, repeated measures on the same person are related, and neighbors might influence each other. Special methods handle these dependencies.\n\n\nHomoscedasticity\nAssumes error variance is constant. But prediction errors might be larger for high-income people than low-income people. Diagnostic plots help detect this.\n\n\nNormality\nAssumes errors follow normal distribution. Important for small samples and hypothesis tests, less critical for large samples.\nNote: The first assumption (exogeneity) is about getting the right answer. The others are mostly about precision and statistical inference. Violating exogeneity means your model is fundamentally wrong; violating the others means your confidence intervals and p-values might be off.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommon Statistical Pitfalls\n\n\n\n\nEndogeneity (omitted variable bias): Forgetting about hidden factors that affect both X and Y, violating the fundamental exogeneity assumption. Example: Studying education→income without accounting for ability.\nSimultaneity/Reverse causality: When X and Y determine each other at the same time. Simple regression assumes one-way causation, but reality is often bidirectional. Example: Price affects demand AND demand affects price simultaneously.\nConfounding: Failing to account for variables that affect both predictor and outcome, leading to spurious relationships. Example: Ice cream sales correlate with drownings (both caused by summer).\nSelection bias: Non-random samples that systematically exclude certain groups, making results ungeneralizable. Example: Surveying only smartphone users about internet usage.\nEcological fallacy: Assuming group-level patterns apply to individuals. Example: Rich countries have lower birth rates ≠ rich people have fewer children.\nP-hacking (data dredging): Testing multiple hypotheses until finding significance, or tweaking analysis until p &lt; 0.05. With 20 tests, you expect 1 false positive by chance alone!\nOverfitting: Building a model too complex for your data - perfect on training data, useless for prediction. Remember: With enough parameters, you can fit an elephant.\nSurvivorship bias: Analyzing only “survivors” while ignoring failures. Example: Studying successful companies while ignoring those that went bankrupt.\nOvergeneralization: Extending findings beyond the studied population, time period, or context. Example: Results from US college students ≠ universal human behavior.\n\nRemember: The first three are forms of endogeneity - they violate E[\\varepsilon|X]=0 and make your coefficients fundamentally wrong. The others make results misleading or non-representative.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApplications in Demography\n\nFertility Analysis\nUnderstanding what factors influence fertility decisions: \\text{Children} = f(\\text{Education, Income, Urban, Religion, Contraception, …})\nHelps identify policy levers for countries concerned about high or low fertility.\nPolicy levers are the tools and methods that governments and organizations use to influence events and achieve specific goals by affecting behavior and outcomes.\n\n\nMortality Modeling\nPredicting life expectancy or mortality risk: \\text{Mortality Risk} = f(\\text{Age, Sex, Smoking, Education, Healthcare Access, …})\nUsed by insurance companies, public health officials, and researchers.\n\n\nMigration Prediction\nUnderstanding who migrates and why: P(\\text{Migration}) = f(\\text{Age, Education, Employment, Family Ties, Distance, …})\nHelps predict population flows and plan for demographic change.\n\n\nMarriage and Divorce\nAnalyzing union formation and dissolution: P(\\text{Divorce}) = f(\\text{Age at Marriage, Education Match, Income, Children, Duration, …})\nInforms social policy and support services.\n\n\n\nCommon Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them\n\nOverfitting\nIncluding too many predictors can make the model fit perfectly in your sample but fail with new data. Like memorizing exam answers instead of understanding concepts.\nSolution: Use simpler models, cross-validation, or reserve some data for testing.\n\n\nMulticollinearity\nWhen predictors are highly correlated (e.g., years of education and degree level), the model can’t separate their effects.\nSolution: Choose one variable or combine them into an index.\n\n\nOmitted Variable Bias\nLeaving out important variables can make other effects appear stronger or weaker than they really are.\nExample: The relationship between ice cream sales and crime rates disappears when you control for temperature.\n\n\nExtrapolation\nUsing the model outside the range of observed data.\nExample: If your data includes education from 0-20 years, don’t predict income for someone with 30 years of education.\n\n\n\nMaking Regression Intuitive\nThink of regression as a sophisticated averaging technique:\n\nSimple average: “The average income is $50,000”\nConditional average: “The average income for college graduates is $70,000”\nRegression: “The average income for 35-year-old college graduates in urban areas is $78,000”\n\nEach added variable makes our prediction more specific and (hopefully) more accurate.\n\n\nRegression in Practice: A Complete Example\nResearch Question: What factors influence age at first birth?\nData: Survey of 1,000 women who have had at least one child\nVariables:\n\nOutcome: Age at first birth (years)\nPredictors: Education (years), Urban (0/1), Income (thousands), Religious (0/1)\n\nSimple Regression Result: \\text{Age at First Birth} = 18 + 0.8 \\times \\text{Education}\nInterpretation: Each year of education associated with 0.8 years later first birth.\nMultiple Regression Result: \\text{Age at First Birth} = 16 + 0.5 \\times \\text{Education} + 2 \\times \\text{Urban} + 0.03 \\times \\text{Income} - 1.5 \\times \\text{Religious}\nInterpretation:\n\nEducation effect reduced but still positive (0.5 years per education year)\nUrban women have first births 2 years later\nEach $1,000 income associated with 0.03 years (11 days) later\nReligious women have first births 1.5 years earlier\nR^2 = 0.42 (model explains 42% of variation)\n\nThis richer model helps us understand that education’s effect partly operates through urban residence and income.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nRegression is a gateway to advanced statistical modeling. Once you understand the basic concept—using variables to predict outcomes and quantifying relationships—you can explore:\n\nInteraction effects: When one variable’s effect depends on another\nNon-linear relationships: Curves, thresholds, and complex patterns\nMultilevel models: Accounting for grouped data (students in schools, people in neighborhoods)\nTime series regression: Analyzing change over time\nMachine learning extensions: Random forests, neural networks, and more\n\nThe key insight remains: We’re trying to understand how things relate to each other in a systematic, quantifiable way.",

    "text": "1.18 Common Misconceptions in Statistics\nUnderstanding what statistics is NOT is as important as understanding what it is.\n\nMisconception 1: “Statistics Can Prove Anything”\nReality: Statistics can only provide evidence, never absolute proof. And proper statistics, honestly applied, constrains conclusions significantly.\nExample: A study finds correlation between ice cream sales and drowning deaths. Statistics doesn’t “prove” ice cream causes drowning—both are related to summer weather.\n\n\nMisconception 2: “Larger Samples Are Always Better”\nReality: Beyond a certain point, larger samples add little precision but may add bias.\nExample: Online survey with 1 million responses may be less accurate than probability sample of 1,000 due to self-selection bias.\nDiminishing Returns:\n\nn = 100: Margin of error \\approx 10%\nn = 1,000: Margin of error \\approx 3.2%\nn = 10,000: Margin of error \\approx 1%\nn = 100,000: Margin of error \\approx 0.32%\n\nThe jump from 10,000 to 100,000 barely improves precision but costs 10\\times more.\n\n\nMisconception 3: “Statistical Significance = Practical Importance”\nReality: With large samples, tiny differences become “statistically significant” even if meaningless.\nExample: Study of 100,000 people finds men are 0.1 cm taller on average (p &lt; 0.001). Statistically significant but practically irrelevant.\n\n\nMisconception 4: “Correlation Implies Causation”\nReality: Correlation is necessary but not sufficient for causation.\nClassic Examples:\n\nCities with more churches have more crime (both correlate with population size)\nCountries with more TV sets have longer life expectancy (both correlate with development)\n\n\n\nMisconception 5: “Random Means Haphazard”\nReality: Statistical randomness is carefully controlled and systematic.\nExample: Random sampling requires careful procedure, not just grabbing whoever is convenient.\n\n\nMisconception 6: “Average Represents Everyone”\nReality: Averages can be misleading when distributions are skewed or multimodal.\nExample: Average income of bar patrons is $50,000. Bill Gates walks in. Now average is $1 million. Nobody’s actual income changed.\n\n\nMisconception 7: “Past Patterns Guarantee Future Results”\nReality: Extrapolation assumes conditions remain constant.\nExample: Linear population growth projection from 1950-2000 would badly overestimate 2050 population because it misses fertility decline.",

    "text": "Statystyka to nauka o uczeniu się z danych w warunkach niepewności.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nStatystyka to nauka o zbieraniu, organizowaniu, analizowaniu, interpretowaniu i prezentowaniu danych. Obejmuje zarówno metody pracy z danymi, jak i teoretyczne podstawy uzasadniające te metody. Ale statystyka to coś więcej niż tylko liczby i wzory — to sposób myślenia o niepewności i zmienności w otaczającym nas świecie.\n\n\n\n\n\nWyboru reprezentatywnej grupy osób do badania\nObliczenia podsumowań opisowych na podstawie ich odpowiedzi\nOszacowania prawdopodobnej średniej dla całej populacji\nOkreślenia, jak pewni możemy być naszego oszacowania\nSprawdzenia, czy średni wiek zmienia się w czasie\n\n\n\nDemografia to nauka zajmująca się badaniem ludności, koncentrująca się na jej wielkości, strukturze, rozmieszczeniu i zmianach zachodzących w czasie. To zasadniczo analiza statystyczna populacji - kim są ludzie, gdzie mieszkają, ilu ich jest i jak te charakterystyki ewoluują.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProcent vs punkty procentowe (pp)\n\n\n\nGdy w mediach słyszysz, że „bezrobocie spadło o 2”, czy chodzi o 2 punkty procentowe (pp), czy 2 procent?\nTo nie to samo:\n\n2 pp (zmiana absolutna): np. 10% → 8% (−2 pp).\n2% (zmiana względna): mnożymy starą stopę przez 0,98; np. 10% → 9,8% (−0,2 pp).\n\nZawsze pytaj:\n\nJaka jest wartość bazowa (wcześniejsza stopa)?\nCzy to zmiana absolutna (pp), czy względna (%)?\nCzy różnica może wynikać z błędu losowego / błędu próby?\nJak mierzono bezrobocie (badanie ankietowe vs dane administracyjne), kiedy i kogo uwzględniono?\n\nProsta zasada\n\nUżywaj punktów procentowych (pp), gdy porównujesz stopy/procenty wprost (bezrobocie, frekwencja).\nUżywaj procentów (%) dla zmian względnych (względem wartości wyjściowej).\n\nMała ściąga\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStopa początkowa\n„Spadek o 2%” (względny)\n„Spadek o 2 pp” (absolutny)\n\n\n\n\n6%\n6% × 0,98 = 5,88% (−0,12 pp)\n4%\n\n\n8%\n8% × 0,98 = 7,84% (−0,16 pp)\n6%\n\n\n10%\n10% × 0,98 = 9,8% (−0,2 pp)\n8%\n\n\n\nUwaga: 2% ≠ 2 punkty procentowe (pp).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nZaokrąglenia i notacja naukowa w statystyce\n\n\n\nZasada główna: O ile nie podano inaczej, części ułamkowe liczb dziesiętnych zaokrąglaj do co najmniej 2 cyfr znaczących. W statystyce często pracujemy z długimi częściami ułamkowymi i bardzo małymi liczbami — w obliczeniach, nie zaokrąglaj nadmiernie w krokach pośrednich, zaokrąglaj na końcu obliczeń.\n\nZaokrąglanie w kontekście statystycznym\nCzęść ułamkowa to cyfry po przecinku dziesiętnym. W statystyce szczególnie ważne jest zachowanie odpowiedniej precyzji:\nStatystyki opisowe:\n\nŚrednia: \\bar{x} = 15.847693... \\rightarrow 15.85\nOdchylenie standardowe: s = 2.7488... \\rightarrow 2.75\nWspółczynnik korelacji: r = 0.78432... \\rightarrow 0.78\n\nBardzo małe liczby (p-wartości, prawdopodobieństwa):\n\np = 0.000347... \\rightarrow 0.00035 lub 3.5 \\times 10^{-4}\nP(X &gt; 2) = 0.0000891... \\rightarrow 0.000089 lub 8.9 \\times 10^{-5}\n\n\n\nCyfry znaczące w części ułamkowej\nW części ułamkowej cyfry znaczące to wszystkie cyfry oprócz zer wiodących:\n\n.78432 ma 5 cyfr znaczących → zaokrąglamy do .78 (2 c.z.)\n.000347 ma 3 cyfry znaczące → zaokrąglamy do .00035 (2 c.z.)\n.050600 ma 4 cyfry znaczące → zaokrąglamy do .051 (2 c.z.)\n\n\n\nZasady zaokrąglania w statystyce\n\nZaokrąglaj tylko część ułamkową do co najmniej 2 cyfr znaczących\nCzęść całkowita pozostaje niezmieniona\nW długich obliczeniach zachowuj 3-4 cyfry w części ułamkowej do ostatniego kroku\nNIGDY nie zaokrąglaj do zera - małe wartości mają znaczenie interpretacyjne\nDla bardzo małych liczb używaj notacji naukowej gdy to ułatwia odczyt\nP-wartości często wymagają większej precyzji — zachowaj 2-3 cyfry znaczące\n\n⚠️ UWAGA: Nie zaokrąglaj do zera!\n\n\nNotacja naukowa w statystyce\nW statystyce często spotykamy bardzo małe liczby. Używaj notacji naukowej gdy ułatwia to odczyt:\nP-wartości i prawdopodobieństwa:\n\np = 0.000347 = 3.47 \\times 10^{-4} (lepiej: 3.5 \\times 10^{-4})\nP(Z &gt; 3.5) = 0.000233 = 2.33 \\times 10^{-4}\n\nBardzo małe odchylenia standardowe:\n\n\\sigma = 0.000892 = 8.92 \\times 10^{-4}\n\nDuże liczby (rzadko w podstawowej statystyce):\n\nN = 1\\,234\\,567 = 1.23 \\times 10^6\n\nWątpliwości: Lepiej zachować dodatkową cyfrę niż zaokrąglić zbyt mocno\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStatystyka opisowa (Descriptive Statistics)\nStatystyka opisowa obejmuje metody podsumowywania i prezentowania danych. Obejmuje to:\nMiary tendencji centralnej - Gdzie znajduje się “centrum” (średnia) zbioru danych?\n\nŚrednia (Mean): Średnia arytmetyczna. Jeśli całkowity dochód gospodarstw domowych na wsi liczącej 100 gospodarstw wynosi 5 000 000 zł, średni dochód wynosi 50 000 zł. Jednak jeśli jedno gospodarstwo jest niezwykle bogate, może to nie reprezentować dobrze typowego gospodarstwa.\nMediana (Median): Wartość środkowa, gdy dane są uporządkowane. Jeśli większość gospodarstw zarabia między 20 000-40 000 zł, ale jedno zarabia 2 000 000 zł, mediana lepiej reprezentuje typowe gospodarstwo.\nModa/Dominanta (Mode): Najczęściej występująca wartość. W badaniu wielkości rodziny, jeśli większość rodzin ma 2 dzieci, 2 jest modą (dominantą), nawet jeśli średnia wynosi 2,3 dziecka.\n\nMiary zmienności - Jak rozrzucone/zróżnicowane są dane?\n\nRozstęp (Range): Różnica między wartością maksymalną a minimalną. Jeśli wiek w społeczności waha się od 0 do 95 lat, rozstęp wynosi 95 lat.\nWariancja (Variance): Średnie kwadratowe odchylenie od średniej. Mierzy, jak daleko wartości przeciętnie odchylają się od centrum.\nOdchylenie standardowe (Standard Deviation): Pierwiastek kwadratowy z wariancji, w tych samych jednostkach co oryginalne dane. Jeśli średni wiek wynosi 35 lat z odchyleniem standardowym 20 lat, większość ludzi ma między 15 a 55 lat.\n\nReprezentacje wizualne (przykłady)\n\nPiramidy wieku (Population Pyramids): Pokazują rozkład wieku i płci, ujawniając historię demograficzną. Szeroka podstawa wskazuje na wysokie wskaźniki urodzeń; wąska podstawa sugeruje spadającą płodność.\nTablice trwania życia (Life Tables): Podsumowują wzorce śmiertelności, pokazując prawdopodobieństwo przeżycia do każdego wieku.\nWykresy szeregów czasowych (Time Series Graphs): Wyświetlają trendy w czasie, takie jak zmieniające się wskaźniki płodności na przestrzeni dekad.\n\n\n\n\nhttps://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:%C5%81%C3%B3d%C5%BA_population_pyramid.svg\n\n\n\n\nWnioskowanie statystyczne (Inferential Statistics)\nWnioskowanie statystyczne to szacowanie efektów na podstawie próby i określanie, jak bardzo te wyniki są niepewne. Stosujemy je w eksperymentach (porównanie grup), w modelach regresji (współczynniki opisujące związek między zmiennymi) oraz w sondażach, gdzie z próby wnioskujemy o populacji (np. odsetki/średnie) i podajemy margines błędu oraz przedział ufności.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWnioskowanie z próby o cechach populacji: Analogia „próbowania zupy”\n\n\n\n\nRozważmy kucharza przygotowującego zupę dla 100 osób, który musi ocenić jej smak bez konsumowania całego garnka:\nPopulacja: Cały garnek zupy (100 porcji)\nPróba: Jedna łyżka do spróbowania\nParametr populacji: Prawdziwy średni poziom słoności całego garnka (nieznany)\nStatystyka z próby: Poziom słoności wykryty w łyżce (obserwowalny)\nWnioskowanie statystyczne: Używanie charakterystyk łyżki do wyciągania wniosków o całym garnku\n\nWażne\n1. Losowe próbkowanie jest niezbędne: Kucharz musi dokładnie wymieszać zupę przed pobraniem próbki. Konsekwentne pobieranie próbek z powierzchni może pominąć przyprawy, które osiadły, wprowadzając systematyczne obciążenie.\n2. Wielkość próby wpływa na precyzję: Większa łyżka dostarcza bardziej wiarygodnych informacji o ogólnym smaku niż mały łyk, choć np. koszty i czas ograniczają możliwość dowolnego zwiększania próby.\n3. Niepewność jest nieodłączna: Nawet przy właściwej technice próbkowania (sampling), łyżka może nie reprezentować idealnie charakterystyk całego garnka.\n4. Systematyczne obciążenie/stronniczość (bias) podważa wnioskowanie: Jeśli ktoś potajemnie doda sól tylko do obszaru próbkowania, wnioski o całym garnku stają się nieważne — ilustrując, jak obciążenie próbkowania zniekształca wnioskowanie statystyczne.\n5. Wnioskowanie ma ograniczenia zakresu: Próba może oszacować średnią słoność, ale nie może ujawnić, czy niektóre części są bardziej słone niż inne, podkreślając granice tego, co próby mogą nam powiedzieć o zmienności w populacji.\nTa analogia chwyta istotę rozumowania statystycznego: używanie starannie wybranych prób do poznawania większych populacji przy jednoczesnym jawnym uznawaniu i kwantyfikacji nieodłącznej niepewności w tym procesie.\n\n\n\n\nNa przykład, jeśli badanie 1000 gospodarstw domowych stwierdza, że 23% obejmuje trzy pokolenia mieszkające razem, statystyka inferencyjna pomaga nam:\n\n\nOszacować, że między 20% a 26% wszystkich gospodarstw w populacji prawdopodobnie ma taką strukturę (przedział ufności)\nSprawdzić, czy ten odsetek wzrósł w porównaniu do poprzedniej dekady (testowanie hipotez)\nZbadać, czy mieszkanie wielopokoleniowe jest bardziej powszechne w niektórych grupach etnicznych (porównanie grup)\nPrzewidzieć przyszłe trendy na podstawie obecnych wzorców (regresja i prognozowanie)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nPodstawowa zasada: Statystyka nie eliminuje niepewności — pomaga nam ją mierzyć, zarządzać nią i skutecznie komunikować.\n\n\n\n\nMyślenie Statystyczne: Wprowadzenie\n\nScenariusz Badawczy\nWładze uniwersytetu rozważają udostępnienie biblioteki całodobowo. Administracja potrzebuje odpowiedzi na pytanie: Jaka część studentów popiera tę zmianę?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPodstawowe Wyzwanie\n\n\n\nSytuacja idealna: Zapytanie wszystkich 20 000 studentów → Uzyskanie dokładnej odpowiedzi\nSytuacja rzeczywista: Ankietowanie 100 studentów → Uzyskanie oszacowania z niepewnością\n\n\n\n\nDwa Podejścia do Tych Samych Danych\nZałóżmy, że przeprowadzono ankietę wśród 100 losowo wybranych studentów i stwierdzono, że 60 z nich popiera całodobowe otwarcie biblioteki.\n\n\n❌ Bez Myślenia Statystycznego\n“60 ze 100 studentów odpowiedziało twierdząco.”\nWniosek: “Dokładnie 60% wszystkich studentów popiera zmianę.”\nDecyzja: “Ponieważ przekracza to 50%, mamy wyraźne poparcie większości.”\nProblem: Ignorowanie faktu, że inna próba mogłaby dać wynik 55% lub 65%\n\n✅ Z Zastosowaniem Myślenia Statystycznego\n“60 ze 100 studentów odpowiedziało twierdząco.”\nWniosek: “Szacujemy poparcie na poziomie 60% z marginesem błędu ±10%”\nDecyzja: “Prawdziwe poparcie prawdopodobnie mieści się między 50% a 70% — potrzebujemy większej próby dla pewności większościowego poparcia.”\nPrzewaga: Uznanie niepewności prowadzi do lepszych decyzji\n\n\n\n\nZnaczenie Praktyczne\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWażna uwaga\n\n\n\nMyślenie statystyczne nie polega na zmniejszeniu pewności — polega na rzetelnym przedstawieniu niepewności.\nRozważmy następujące scenariusze dla wyniku 60% (±10% margines błędu):\n\nScenariusz optymistyczny: Rzeczywiste poparcie może wynosić 70% (silna większość)\nScenariusz pesymistyczny: Rzeczywiste poparcie może wynosić 50% (brak wyraźnej większości)\nScenariusz najbardziej prawdopodobny: Rzeczywiste poparcie wynosi około 60% (umiarkowana większość)\n\nBez uwzględnienia tego zakresu możemy podejmować kosztowne decyzje oparte na fałszywej precyzji.\n\n\n\n\nZnaczenie Wielkości Próby\nJeśli wymagana jest większa precyzja, należy rozważyć wpływ wielkości próby na poziom ufności:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWielkość Próby\nWynik Badania\nMargines Błędu\nPrzedział Ufności\nInterpretacja\n\n\n\n\nn = 100\n60%\n±10%\n50% do 70%\nNiepewność co do większości\n\n\nn = 400\n60%\n±5%\n55% do 65%\nPrawdopodobne poparcie większości\n\n\nn = 1 600\n60%\n±2,5%\n57,5% do 62,5%\nWyraźne poparcie większości\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNależy Pamiętać\n\n\n\nMyślenie statystyczne przekształca stwierdzenie “60 studentów odpowiedziało twierdząco” z pozornie precyzyjnej, lecz wprowadzającej w błąd informacji w rzetelną ocenę: “Z dużym prawdopodobieństwem można stwierdzić, że między 50% a 70% wszystkich studentów popiera tę propozycję.”\nTa ostrożność w formułowaniu wniosków prowadzi do lepszych decyzji.\n\n\n\n\nZastosowanie Myślenia Statystycznego w Praktyce\nAnalizując dane statystyczne, należy zawsze rozważyć następujące pytania:\n\nJaka jest wielkość próby badawczej?\nJaki jest margines błędu statystycznego?\nCzy prawdziwa wartość może znacząco różnić się od wartości raportowanej?\nCzy decyzja uległaby zmianie, gdyby prawdziwa wartość znajdowała się na granicy przedziału niepewności/ufności?\n\nOdpowiedzi na te pytania stanowią fundament myślenia statystycznego.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrzykład historyczny: Sondaż Literary Digest z 1936 roku\n\n\n\nLiterary Digest przeprowadził jeden z największych sondaży w historii z 2,4 miliona odpowiedzi, przewidując, że Alf Landon pokona Franklina D. Roosevelta w wyborach prezydenckich w 1936 roku.\nPomimo ogromnej wielkości próby:\nPrzewidywanie: Landon 57%, Roosevelt 43% Rzeczywisty wynik: Roosevelt 62%, Landon 38% Błąd: 25 punktów procentowych!\nCo poszło nie tak? Sondaż był wadliwy z powodu systematycznego błędu/obciążenia (bias):\nObciążenie selekcyjne (selection bias) w ramce/operacie losowania:\n\nŹródła: książki telefoniczne, rejestracje samochodów, członkostwo w klubach\nProblem: W 1936 roku źródła te nadreprezentowały bogatych Amerykanów, którzy faworyzowali Landona\nWynik: Próba systematycznie wykluczała zwolenników Roosevelta\n\nObciążenie braku odpowiedzi:\n\nTylko 24% skontaktowanych osób odpowiedziało (problem z “response rate”)\nPrawdopodobni respondenci: osoby z silnymi opiniami anty-Roosevelt\nStruktura odmów: wielu zwolenników Roosevelta nie czuło potrzeby uczestniczenia\n\nKluczowe wnioski:\n\nDuża obciążona (biased) próba jest gorsza niż mała reprezentatywna próba\nBłędy standardowe mierzą tylko błąd losowy, nie obciążenie\nWielkość próby nie może naprawić fundamentalnych problemów dotyczących nielosowego doboru próby\nReprezentatywne losowanie ma większe znaczenie niż wielkość próby\n\nTa katastrofa doprowadziła do znacznych ulepszeń w metodologii sondażowej, w tym rozwoju losowania probabilistycznego i śledzenia wskaźników odpowiedzi.\n\n\n\n\n\nWspółczesne sondaże\nDzisiejsze sondaże, choć znacznie mniejsze niż 2,4 miliona odpowiedzi Literary Digest, są zwykle znacznie dokładniejsze, ponieważ koncentrują się na:\nReprezentatywnym losowaniu: Używanie metod opartych na prawdopodobieństwie, aby zapewnić wszystkim grupom znane szanse selekcji\nWykrywanie i korekcja obciążenia: Monitorowanie wskaźników odpowiedzi w różnych grupach demograficznych i korygowanie znanych obciążeń (bias)\nKwantyfikacja niepewności: Raportowanie marginesów błędu (statystyczny błąd losowy), które uczciwie komunikują granice tego, co wiemy\nPrzykład: Współczesny sondaż 1000 losowo wybranych wyborców z 3% marginesem błędu jest zwykle znacznie bardziej wiarygodny niż masywne, ale obciążone badanie Literary Digest.",

Typ danych określa, jakie operacje matematyczne są wykonalne i jakie metody statystyczne mają zastosowanie.\n\nDane ilościowe\nDane ciągłe mogą przyjmować dowolną wartość w przedziale:\nPrzykłady o znaczeniu demograficznym:\n\nWiek: Może wynosić 25,5 lat, 25,51 lat, 25,514 lat (precyzja ograniczona tylko dokładnością narzędzia pomiarowego)\nWskaźnik masy ciała: 23,7 kg/m²\nWspółczynnik dzietności: 1,73 dzieci na kobietę\nGęstość zaludnienia: 4521,3 osoby na km²\n\nWłaściwości:\n\nMożna wykonywać wszystkie operacje arytmetyczne\nMożna obliczać średnie, odchylenia standardowe\nCzęsto “podążają” za znanymi rozkładami prawdopodobieństwa (np. waga za rozkładem normalnym)\n\nDane dyskretne mogą przyjmować tylko określone wartości:\nPrzykłady:\n\nLiczba dzieci: 0, 1, 2, 3… (nie można mieć 2,5 dziecka)\nLiczba małżeństw: 0, 1, 2, 3…\nWielkość gospodarstwa domowego: 1, 2, 3, 4… osób\nLiczba wizyt u lekarza: 0, 1, 2, 3… rocznie\n\n\n\nDane jakościowe/kategorialne\nDane nominalne reprezentują kategorie bez naturalnego porządku:\nPrzykłady:\n\nKraj urodzenia: USA, Chiny, Indie, Brazylia…\nReligia: Chrześcijaństwo, Islam, Hinduizm, Buddyzm, Brak…\nStan cywilny: Kawaler/Panna, Żonaty/Mężatka, Rozwiedziony/a, Wdowiec/Wdowa\nPrzyczyna śmierci: Choroby serca, Rak, Wypadek, Udar…\nGrupa krwi: A, B, AB, 0\n\nCo możemy zrobić:\n\nLiczyć częstości\nObliczać proporcje\nZnaleźć modę\nTestować niezależność\n\nCzego nie możemy zrobić:\n\nObliczać średniej (średnia religia nie ma sensu)\nPorządkować kategorii znacząco\nObliczać odległości między kategoriami\n\nDane porządkowe reprezentują uporządkowane kategorie:\nPrzykłady:\n\nPoziom wykształcenia: Brak &lt; Podstawowe &lt; Średnie &lt; Wyższe\nStatus społeczno-ekonomiczny: Niski &lt; Średni &lt; Wysoki\nSamoocena zdrowia: Zły &lt; Przeciętny &lt; Dobry &lt; Doskonały\nSkala zgody: Zdecydowanie się nie zgadzam &lt; Nie zgadzam się &lt; Neutralny &lt; Zgadzam się &lt; Zdecydowanie się zgadzam\n\nUwaga: Interwały między kategoriami niekoniecznie są równe. „Odległość” od Złego do Przeciętnego zdrowia może nie równać się odległości od Dobrego do Doskonałego.\n\n\n\nRozkład Danych\nRozkład danych (data distribution) opisuje, jak wartości rozkładają się między możliwymi wynikami (jakie wartości przyjmuje zmienna i jak często). Rozkłady mówią nam, które wartości są powszechne, które są rzadkie i jakie wzorce istnieją w naszych danych.\nZrozumienie rozkładów jest fundamentalne dla statystyki, ponieważ pomaga nam podsumowywać duże zbiory danych, identyfikować wzorce i podejmować świadome decyzje.\nNa przykład, wiedza o tym, że większość studentów uzyskuje wyniki między 60-80 punktów na egzaminie, mówi nam więcej niż sama średnia.\n\nCzęstość, Częstość Względna i Gęstość\nAnalizując dane, często interesuje nas, ile razy pojawia się każda wartość (lub przedział wartości). Prowadzi nas to do trzech powiązanych pojęć:\nCzęstość (bezwzględna) (frequency) to po prostu liczba wystąpień danej wartości lub kategorii w naszych danych. Jeśli 15 studentów uzyskało wyniki między 70-80 punktów na egzaminie, częstość dla tego przedziału wynosi 15.\nCzęstość względna (relative frequency) wyraża częstość jako proporcję lub procent całości. Odpowiada na pytanie: “Jaka część wszystkich obserwacji należy do tej kategorii?” Częstość względna obliczana jest jako:\n\\text{Częstość względna} = \\frac{\\text{Częstość}}{\\text{Całkowita liczba obserwacji}}\nJeśli 15 ze 100 studentów uzyskało 70-80 punktów, częstość względna wynosi 15/100 = 0,15 lub 15%. Częstości względne zawsze sumują się do 1 (lub 100%), co czyni je użytecznymi do porównywania rozkładów o różnych liczebnościach próby.\nGęstość (density) jest podobna do częstości względnej, ale uwzględnia szerokość przedziałów. Gdy grupujemy dane ciągłe (takie jak czas czy stopa bezrobocia) w przedziały o różnych szerokościach, gęstość zapewnia uczciwe porównanie. Gęstość obliczana jest jako:\n\\text{Gęstość} = \\frac{\\text{Częstość względna}}{\\text{Szerokość przedziału}}\nGęstość jest szczególnie ważna dla zmiennych ciągłych, ponieważ zapewnia, że całkowite pole pod rozkładem równa się 1, co pozwala nam interpretować pola jako prawdopodobieństwa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nPrawdopodobieństwo zdarzenia to liczba z przedziału od 0 do 1; im większe prawdopodobieństwo, tym bardziej prawdopodobne jest wystąpienie zdarzenia.\n\n\nCzęstość skumulowana (cumulative frequency) mówi nam, ile obserwacji znajduje się na danym poziomie lub poniżej niego. Zamiast pytać “ile obserwacji jest w tej kategorii?”, częstość skumulowana odpowiada na pytanie “ile obserwacji jest w tej kategorii lub w kategoriach poniżej?”. Obliczana jest przez sumowanie wszystkich częstości od najniższej wartości do bieżącej wartości włącznie.\nPodobnie, częstość względna skumulowana (cumulative relative frequency) wyraża to jako proporcję całości, odpowiadając na pytanie “jaki procent obserwacji znajduje się na tym poziomie lub poniżej?”. Jest to szczególnie użyteczne do zrozumienia percentyli i kwartyli. Na przykład, jeśli częstość względna skumulowana dla wyniku 70 wynosi 0,40, oznacza to, że 40% studentów uzyskało wynik 70 lub niższy.\n\n\nTablice Rozkładu (szereg rozdzielczy danych)\nTablica rozkładu częstości (frequency distribution table) organizuje dane, pokazując jak obserwacje rozkładają się między różnymi wartościami lub przedziałami. Oto przykład z wynikami egzaminów:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrzedział wyników\nCzęstość\nCzęstość względna\nCzęstość skumulowana\nCzęstość względna skumulowana\nGęstość\n\n\n\n\n0-50\n10\n0,10\n10\n0,10\n0,002\n\n\n50-70\n30\n0,30\n40\n0,40\n0,015\n\n\n70-90\n45\n0,45\n85\n0,85\n0,0225\n\n\n90-100\n15\n0,15\n100\n1,00\n0,015\n\n\nSuma\n100\n1,00\n-\n-\n-\n\n\n\nTa tablica pokazuje, że większość studentów uzyskała wyniki w przedziale 70-90, podczas gdy bardzo niewielu uzyskało wyniki poniżej 50 lub powyżej 90. Kolumny skumulowane pokazują nam, że 40% studentów uzyskało wyniki poniżej 70, a 85% poniżej 90.\nTakie tablice są użyteczne dla szybkiego przeglądu danych przed przeprowadzeniem bardziej złożonych analiz.\n\n\nWizualizacja Rozkładów: Histogramy\nHistogram to graficzna reprezentacja rozkładu częstości. Wyświetla dane używając słupków, gdzie:\n\nOś x pokazuje wartości lub przedziały (klasy, bins)\nOś y może pokazywać częstość, częstość względną lub gęstość\nWysokość każdego słupka reprezentuje liczbę, proporcję lub gęstość dla danego przedziału\nSłupki stykają się ze sobą (brak przerw) dla zmiennych ciągłych\n\nWybór szerokości klas: Liczba i szerokość klas znacząco wpływa na wygląd histogramu. Zbyt mało klas ukrywa ważne wzorce, podczas gdy zbyt wiele klas tworzy “szum” i utrudnia dostrzeżenie wzorców.\n\nW statystyce szum (noise) to niepożądana losowa zmienność, która przesłania wzorzec, który staramy się znaleźć. Można to porównać do trzasków w radiu — utrudniają one słyszenie muzyki (“sygnału”). W danych szum pochodzi z błędów pomiarowych, losowych fluktuacji lub naturalnej zmienności badanego zjawiska. Szum to losowa zmienność w danych, która ukrywa prawdziwe wzorce, które chcemy dostrzec, podobnie jak hałas w tle utrudnia usłyszenie rozmowy.\n\nKilka metod pomaga określić odpowiednie szerokości klas:\n\nReguła Sturgesa (Sturges’ rule): Użyj k = 1 + \\log_2(n) klas, gdzie n to liczebność próby. Działa dobrze dla w przybliżeniu symetrycznych rozkładów.\nReguła pierwiastka kwadratowego (square root rule): Użyj k = \\sqrt{n} klas. Proste, domyślne ustawienie działające w wielu przypadkach wystarczająco dobrze.\n\nW R możesz określić klasy na kilka sposobów:\n\n# Określenie liczby klas\nhist(exam_scores, breaks = 10)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Określenie dokładnych punktów podziału\nhist(exam_scores, breaks = seq(0, 100, by = 10))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Pozwól R wybrać automatycznie (domyślnie używa reguły Sturgesa)\nhist(exam_scores)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNajlepszym podejściem jest często eksperymentowanie z różnymi szerokościami klas, aby znaleźć to, co najlepiej ujawnia wzorzec w danych. Zacznij od ustawienia domyślnego, następnie spróbuj mniej i więcej klas, aby zobaczyć, jak zmienia się obraz.\nDefiniowanie granic klas: Tworząc klasy dla tablicy częstości, musisz zdecydować, jak obsługiwać wartości, które dokładnie przypadają na granice przedziałów klasowych. Na przykład, jeśli masz klasy 0-10 i 10-20, do której klasy należy wartość 10?\nRozwiązaniem jest użycie notacji przedziałowej (interval notation), aby określić, czy każda granica jest włączona czy wyłączona:\n\nPrzedział domknięty (closed interval) [a, b] zawiera oba końce: a \\leq x \\leq b\nPrzedział otwarty (open interval) (a, b) wyklucza oba końce: a &lt; x &lt; b\nPrzedział lewostronnie domknięty (half-open interval) [a, b) zawiera lewy koniec, ale wyklucza prawy: a \\leq x &lt; b\nPrzedział prawostronnie domknięty (half-open interval) (a, b] wyklucza lewy koniec, ale zawiera prawy: a &lt; x \\leq b\n\nStandardowa konwencja: Większość oprogramowania statystycznego, włączając R, używa przedziałów lewostronnie domkniętych [a, b) dla wszystkich klas oprócz ostatniej, która jest w pełni domknięta [a, b]. Oznacza to:\n\nWartość na dolnej granicy jest włączona do klasy\nWartość na górnej granicy należy do następnej klasy\nSama ostatnia klasa zawiera obie granice, aby uchwycić wartość maksymalną\n\nNa przykład, dla klas 0-20, 20-40, 40-60, 60-80, 80-100:\n\n\n\nPrzedział wyników\nNotacja przedziałowa\nZawarte wartości\n\n\n\n\n0-20\n[0, 20)\n0 ≤ wynik &lt; 20\n\n\n20-40\n[20, 40)\n20 ≤ wynik &lt; 40\n\n\n40-60\n[40, 60)\n40 ≤ wynik &lt; 60\n\n\n60-80\n[60, 80)\n60 ≤ wynik &lt; 80\n\n\n80-100\n[80, 100]\n80 ≤ wynik ≤ 100\n\n\n\nTa konwencja zapewnia, że:\n\nKażda wartość jest liczona dokładnie raz (bez podwójnego liczenia)\nŻadne wartości nie przepadają\nKlasy w pełni pokrywają cały zakres\n\nPrzedstawiając tablice częstości w raportach, możesz po prostu napisać “0-20, 20-40, …” i zaznaczyć, że klasy są lewostronnie domknięte, lub jawnie pokazać notację przedziałową, jeśli precyzja jest ważna.\nHistogram częstości pokazuje surowe liczebności:\n\n# Przykład kodu R\nhist(exam_scores, \n     breaks = seq(0, 100, by = 10),\n     main = \"Rozkład wyników egzaminacyjnych\",\n     xlab = \"Wynik\",\n     ylab = \"Częstość\",\n     col = \"lightblue\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHistogram częstości względnej pokazuje proporcje (użyteczne przy porównywaniu grup o różnych liczebnościach):\n\nhist(exam_scores, \n     breaks = seq(0, 100, by = 10),\n     freq = FALSE,  # Tworzy histogram częstości względnej/gęstości\n     main = \"Rozkład wyników egzaminacyjnych\",\n     xlab = \"Wynik\",\n     ylab = \"Częstość względna\",\n     col = \"lightgreen\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHistogram gęstości dostosowuje się do szerokości przedziałów i jest używany z krzywymi gęstości:\n\nhist(exam_scores, \n     breaks = seq(0, 100, by = 10),\n     freq = FALSE,  # Tworzy skalę gęstości\n     main = \"Rozkład wyników egzaminacyjnych\",\n     xlab = \"Wynik\",\n     ylab = \"Gęstość\",\n     col = \"lightcoral\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKrzywe Gęstości\nKrzywa gęstości (density curve) to wygładzona linia, która przybliża/modeluje kształt rozkładu. W przeciwieństwie do histogramów, które pokazują rzeczywiste dane w dyskretnych klasach, krzywe gęstości pokazują ogólny wzorzec jako funkcję ciągłą. Pole pod całą krzywą zawsze równa się 1, a pole pod dowolną częścią krzywej reprezentuje proporcję obserwacji w tym zakresie.\n\n# Dodawanie krzywej gęstości do histogramu\nhist(exam_scores, \n     freq = FALSE,\n     main = \"Wyniki egzaminacyjne z krzywą gęstości\",\n     xlab = \"Wynik\",\n     ylab = \"Gęstość\",\n     col = \"lightblue\",\n     border = \"white\")\nlines(density(exam_scores), \n      col = \"darkred\", \n      lwd = 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKrzywe gęstości są szczególnie użyteczne do:\n\nIdentyfikacji kształtu rozkładu (symetryczny, skośny, bimodalny)\nPorównywania wielu rozkładów na tym samym wykresie\nZrozumienia teoretycznego (“prawdziwego”) rozkładu leżącego u podstaw danych\n\n\n\nWizualizacja Częstości Skumulowanej\nWykresy częstości skumulowanej, zwane także ogiwami (ogives, wymawiane “oh-dżajw”), pokazują jak częstości kumulują się w zakresie wartości. Te wykresy używają linii zamiast słupków i zawsze rosną od lewej do prawej, ostatecznie osiągając całkowitą liczbę obserwacji (dla częstości skumulowanej) lub 1,0 (dla częstości względnej skumulowanej).\nWykresy częstości skumulowanej są wykorzytywane do:\n\nWizualnego odnajdywania percentyli i kwartyli\nOkreślania, jaka proporcja danych znajduje się poniżej lub powyżej określonej wartości\nPorównywania rozkładów różnych grup\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nW statystyce percentyl (percentile) wskazuje względną pozycję punktu danych w zbiorze, pokazując procent obserwacji, które znajdują się na tym poziomie lub poniżej. Na przykład, jeśli student uzyskał wynik na 90. percentylu w teście, jego wynik jest równy lub wyższy niż 90% wszystkich innych wyników.\nKwartyle (quartiles) to specjalne percentyle, które dzielą dane na cztery równe części: pierwszy kwartyl (Q1, 25. percentyl), drugi kwartyl (Q2, 50. percentyl, czyli mediana), i trzeci kwartyl (Q3, 75. percentyl). Jeśli Q1 = 65 punktów, oznacza to, że 25% studentów uzyskało 65 punktów lub mniej.\nBardziej ogólnie, kwantyle (quantiles) to wartości, które dzielą dane na grupy o równej liczebności — percentyle dzielą na 100 części, kwartyle na 4 części, decyle (deciles) na 10 części, itp.\n\n\n\n# Tworzenie danych częstości skumulowanej\nscore_breaks &lt;- seq(0, 100, by = 10)\nfreq_counts &lt;- hist(exam_scores, breaks = score_breaks, plot = FALSE)$counts\ncumulative_freq &lt;- cumsum(freq_counts)\n\n# Wykres częstości skumulowanej\nplot(score_breaks[-1], cumulative_freq,\n     type = \"b\",  # zarówno punkty, jak i linie\n     main = \"Częstość skumulowana wyników egzaminacyjnych\",\n     xlab = \"Wynik\",\n     ylab = \"Częstość skumulowana\",\n     col = \"darkblue\",\n     lwd = 2,\n     pch = 19)\ngrid()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDla częstości względnej skumulowanej (która jest częściej używana):\n\n# Częstość względna skumulowana\ncumulative_rel_freq &lt;- cumulative_freq / length(exam_scores)\n\nplot(score_breaks[-1], cumulative_rel_freq,\n     type = \"b\",\n     main = \"Częstość względna skumulowana wyników egzaminacyjnych\",\n     xlab = \"Wynik\",\n     ylab = \"Częstość względna skumulowana\",\n     col = \"darkred\",\n     lwd = 2,\n     pch = 19,\n     ylim = c(0, 1))\ngrid()\nabline(h = c(0.25, 0.5, 0.75), lty = 2, col = \"gray\")  # Linie kwartyli\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKrzywa częstości względnej skumulowanej ułatwia odczytywanie percentyli. Na przykład, jeśli narysujesz linię poziomą na 0,75 i zobaczysz, gdzie przecina krzywą, odpowiadająca wartość x to 75. percentyl — wynik, poniżej którego znajduje się 75% studentów.\n\n\nRozkłady Dyskretne a Ciągłe\nTyp zmiennej, którą analizujesz, określa sposób wizualizacji jej rozkładu:\nRozkłady dyskretne (discrete distributions) stosują się do zmiennych, które mogą przyjmować tylko określone, policzalne wartości.

    "text": "2.3 Populacje i próby\nZrozumienie rozróżnienia między populacjami a próbami jest kluczowe dla właściwej analizy statystycznej. To rozróżnienie wpływa na każdy aspekt naszej analizy, od zbierania danych po interpretację wyników.\n\nPopulacja (Population)\nPopulacja to kompletny zbiór jednostek, obiektów lub pomiarów, o których chcemy wyciągnąć wnioski. Kluczowe słowo to „kompletny” — populacja obejmuje każdego pojedynczego członka grupy, którą badamy.\nPrzykłady populacji w demografii:\n\nWszyscy mieszkańcy Polski na dzień 1 stycznia 2024: Obejmuje każdą osobę mieszkającą w Polsce w tym konkretnym dniu — około 38 milionów osób.\nWszystkie urodzenia w Szwecji w 2023 roku: Każde dziecko urodzone w granicach Szwecji w tym roku kalendarzowym — około 100 000 urodzeń.\nWszystkie gospodarstwa domowe w Tokio: Każda jednostka mieszkalna, gdzie ludzie mieszkają, gotują i śpią — około 7 milionów gospodarstw.\nWszystkie zgony z powodu COVID-19 na świecie w 2020 roku: Każdy zgon, gdzie COVID-19 został wymieniony jako przyczyna — kilka milionów zgonów.\n\nPopulacje mogą być:\nSkończone (Finite): Mające policzalną liczbę członków (wszyscy obecni obywatele Polski, wszytkie gminy w Polsce w 2024 r.)\nNieskończone (Infinite): Teoretyczne lub niepoliczalnie duże (wszystkie możliwe przyszłe urodzenia)\nStałe (Fixed): Zdefiniowane w określonym punkcie czasu (wszyscy mieszkańcy w dniu spisu)\nDynamiczne (Dynamic): Zmieniające się w czasie (populacja miasta doświadczająca urodzeń, zgonów i migracji codziennie)\n\n\nPróba (Sample)\nPróba to podzbiór populacji, który jest faktycznie obserwowany lub mierzony. Badamy próby, ponieważ badanie całych populacji jest często niemożliwe, niepraktyczne lub niepotrzebne.\nDlaczego używamy prób:\nPraktyczna niemożliwość: Wyobraź sobie testowanie każdej osoby w Chinach na obecność pewnej choroby. Zanim skończyłbyś testować 1,4 miliarda ludzi, sytuacja chorobowa całkowicie by się zmieniła, a niektórzy ludzie testowani wcześnie wymagaliby ponownego testowania.\nWzględy kosztowe: Amerykański spis powszechny z 2020 roku kosztował około 16 miliardów dolarów. Przeprowadzanie tak kompletnych wyliczeń często byłoby zbyt kosztowne.\nOgraniczenia czasowe: Decydenci często potrzebują informacji szybko. Badanie ankietowe 10 000 osób można ukończyć w ciągu tygodni, podczas gdy spis wymaga lat planowania, wykonania i przetwarzania.\nPomiar destrukcyjny: Niektóre pomiary niszczą to, co jest mierzone. Testowanie żywotności żarówek wymaga użycia prób.\nWiększa dokładność: Co zaskakujące, próby mogą czasem być dokładniejsze niż badania pełne. Z próbą można pozwolić sobie na lepsze szkolenie ankieterów, bardziej staranne zbieranie danych i dokładniejsze kontrole jakości.\nPrzykład próby vs. populacja:\nPowiedzmy, że chcemy poznać średnią wielkość gospodarstwa domowego w Warszawie:\n\nPopulacja: Wszystkie 800 000 gospodarstw domowych w Warszawie\nPodejście spisowe: Próba skontaktowania się z każdym gospodarstwem (drogie, czasochłonne, niektóre zostaną pominięte)\nPodejście próbkowe: Losowo wybrać 5000 gospodarstw, dokładnie zmierzyć ich wielkości i użyć tego do oszacowania średniej dla wszystkich gospodarstw\nWynik: Próba może znaleźć średnią 2,43 osób na gospodarstwo z marginesem błędu ±0,05, co oznacza, że jesteśmy pewni, że prawdziwa średnia populacji mieści się między 2,38 a 2,48\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuperpopulacja i Proces Generowania Danych (DGP) (*)\n\n\n\n\n\nSuperpopulacja (Superpopulation)\nSuperpopulacja to teoretyczna nieskończona populacja, z której twoja skończona populacja jest traktowana jako jedna losowa próba.\nPomyśl o tym w trzech poziomach:\n\nSuperpopulacja: Nieskończony zbiór możliwych wartości (teoretyczny)\nPopulacja skończona (finite population): Rzeczywista populacja, którą teoretycznie możesz spisać (np. wszystkie 50 stanów USA, wszystkie 10 000 firm w branży)\nPróba (sample): Podzbiór, który faktycznie obserwujesz (np. 30 stanów, 500 firm)\n\nDlaczego potrzebujemy tego pojęcia?\nRozważmy 50 stanów USA. Możesz zmierzyć stopę bezrobocia dla wszystkich 50 stanów — pełny spis, bez próbkowania. Ale nadal chcesz:\n\nSprawdzić, czy bezrobocie jest powiązane z poziomem wykształcenia\nPrzewidzieć przyszłoroczne stopy bezrobocia\nOkreślić, czy różnice między stanami są „istotne statystycznie”\n\nBez koncepcji superpopulacji utkniesz — masz wszystkie dane, więc co pozostaje do wnioskowania? Odpowiedź: traktuj tegoroczne 50 wartości jako jedno losowanie z nieskończonej superpopulacji możliwych wartości, które mogłyby wystąpić w podobnych warunkach.\nReprezentacja matematyczna:\n\nWartość populacji skończonej: Y_i (stopa bezrobocia stanu i)\nModel superpopulacji: Y_i = \\mu + \\epsilon_i gdzie \\epsilon_i \\sim (0, \\sigma^2)\n50 zaobserwowanych wartości to jedna realizacja tego procesu\n\n\n\n\nProces Generowania Danych (Data Generating Process): Prawdziwa Recepta\nProces Generowania Danych (DGP) to rzeczywisty mechanizm, który tworzy twoje dane — włączając wszystkie czynniki, relacje i elementy losowe.\nIntuicyjny przykład: Załóżmy, że wyniki testów uczniów są naprawdę generowane przez:\n\\text{Wynik}_i = 50 + 2(\\text{GodzinyNauki}_i) + 3(\\text{GodzinySnu}_i) - 5(\\text{Stres}_i) + 1.5(\\text{Śniadanie}_i) + \\epsilon_i\nTo jest PRAWDZIWY DGP. Ale ty tego nie wiesz! Możesz estymować:\n\\text{Wynik}_i = \\alpha + \\beta(\\text{GodzinyNauki}_i) + u_i\nTwój model jest prostszy niż rzeczywistość. Brakuje ci zmiennych (sen, stres, śniadanie), więc twoje oszacowania mogą być obciążone (biased). Składnik u_i zawiera wszystko, co pominąłeś.\nKluczowa intuicja: Nigdy nie znamy prawdziwego DGP. Nasze modele statystyczne są zawsze przybliżeniami, próbującymi uchwycić najważniejsze części nieznanej, złożonej prawdy.\n\n\n\nDwa Podejścia do Wnioskowania Statystycznego\nAnalizując dane, szczególnie z badań czy prób, możemy przyjąć dwa filozoficzne podejścia:\n\n1. Wnioskowanie Oparte na Schemacie (Design-Based Inference)\n\nFilozofia: Wartości populacji są stałymi liczbami. Losowość pochodzi TYLKO z tego, które jednostki wylosowaliśmy.\nSkupienie: Jak wybraliśmy próbę (losowanie proste, warstwowe, gniazdowe itp.)\nPrzykład: Średni dochód hrabstw Kalifornii jest stałą liczbą. Losujemy 10 hrabstw. Nasza niepewność wynika z tego, które 10 losowo wybraliśmy.\nBez modeli: Nie zakładamy nic o rozkładzie wartości populacji\n\n\n\n2. Wnioskowanie Oparte na Modelu (Model-Based Inference)\n\nFilozofia: Same wartości populacji są realizacjami z pewnego modelu probabilistycznego (superpopulacji)\nSkupienie: Model statystyczny generujący wartości populacji\nPrzykład: Dochód każdego hrabstwa Kalifornii jest losowany z: Y_i = \\mu + \\epsilon_i gdzie \\epsilon_i \\sim N(0, \\sigma^2)\nWymagane modele: Przyjmujemy założenia o tym, jak dane zostały wygenerowane\n\nKtóre jest lepsze?\n\nDuże populacje, dobre próby losowe: Podejście oparte na schemacie działa dobrze\nMałe populacje (jak 50 stanów): Często konieczne podejście modelowe\nPełne spisanie: Tylko podejście modelowe umożliwia wnioskowanie\nWspółczesna praktyka: Często łączy oba podejścia\n\n\n\n\n\nPraktyczny Przykład: Analiza Wydatków Stanowych na Edukację\nZałóżmy, że zbierasz wydatki na edukację per uczeń dla wszystkich 50 stanów USA.\nBez myślenia superpopulacyjnego:\n\nMasz wszystkie 50 wartości — to wszystko\nŚrednia to średnia, bez niepewności\nNie możesz testować hipotez ani tworzyć prognoz\n\nZ myśleniem superpopulacyjnym:\n\nTegoroczne 50 wartości to jedna realizacja z superpopulacji\nModel: \\text{Wydatki}_i = \\mu + \\beta(\\text{DochódStanu}_i) + \\epsilon_i\nTeraz możesz:\n\nTestować, czy wydatki są powiązane z dochodem stanu (\\beta \\neq 0?)\nPrzewidywać przyszłoroczne wartości\nObliczać przedziały ufności\n\n\nKluczowa intuicja: Nawet z kompletnymi danymi, ramy superpopulacji umożliwiają wnioskowanie statystyczne poprzez traktowanie obserwowanych wartości jako jednego możliwego wyniku z podstawowego procesu stochastycznego.\n\n\n\nPodsumowanie\n\nSuperpopulacja: Traktuje twoją populację skończoną jako jedno losowanie z nieskończonej przestrzeni możliwości — niezbędne, gdy twoja populacja skończona jest mała lub całkowicie obserwowana\nDGP: Prawdziwy (nieznany) proces tworzący twoje dane — twoje modele próbują go przybliżyć",

Ale czy to przyczynowość, czy korelacja? Czy są wyjątki? Jak pewni możemy być naszych wniosków?\nStatystyka dostarcza narzędzi do przejścia od przeczuć do odpowiedzi opartych na dowodach, pomagając nam rozróżnić między tym, co wydaje się prawdziwe, a tym, co rzeczywiście jest prawdziwe.\n\n\nPomiar w naukach społecznych\nW naukach społecznych często zmagamy się z tym, że kluczowe pojęcia nie przekładają się wprost na liczby:\n\nJak zmierzyć „demokrację”?\nJaka liczba oddaje „ideologię polityczną”?\nJak ilościowo ująć „siłę instytucji”?\nJak zmierzyć „partycypację polityczną”?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n🔍 Korelacja ≠ Przyczynowość: Zrozumienie Związków Pozornych (spurious correlation)\n\n\n\n\nFundamentalne Rozróżnienie\nKorelacja (correlation) mierzy, jak dwie zmienne poruszają się razem:\n\nDodatnia: Obie rosną razem (godziny nauki ↑, oceny ↑)\nUjemna: Jedna rośnie, gdy druga maleje (godziny TV ↑, oceny ↓)\nMierzona współczynnikiem korelacji: r \\in [-1, 1]\n\nPrzyczynowość (causation) oznacza, że jedna zmienna bezpośrednio wpływa na drugą:\n\nX \\rightarrow Y: Zmiany w X bezpośrednio powodują zmiany w Y\nWymaga: (1) korelacji, (2) poprzedzania czasowego, (3) braku alternatywnych wyjaśnień\n\n\n\nZagrożenie: Korelacja Pozorna\nKorelacja pozorna (spurious correlation) występuje, gdy dwie zmienne wydają się powiązane, ale w rzeczywistości obie są pod wpływem trzeciej zmiennej (czynnika zakłócającego/confoundera).\nKlasyczny przykład:\n\nObserwacja: Sprzedaż lodów koreluje z liczbą utonięć\nPozorny wniosek: Lody powodują utonięcia (❌)\nRzeczywistość: Letnia pogoda (czynnik zakłócający) powoduje oba zjawiska:\nLato → Więcej sprzedanych lodów\nLato → Więcej pływania → Więcej utonięć\n\nReprezentacja matematyczna:\n\nObserwowana korelacja: \\text{Cor}(X,Y) \\neq 0\nAle prawdziwy model: X = \\alpha Z + \\epsilon_1 oraz Y = \\beta Z + \\epsilon_2\nGdzie Z to zmienna zakłócająca powodująca oba zjawiska\n\n\n\nCzynniki Zakłócające (Confounding): Ukryty Wpływ\nZmienna zakłócająca (confounding variable/confounder):\n\nWpływa zarówno na domniemaną przyczynę, jak i skutek\nTworzy iluzję bezpośredniej przyczynowości\nMusi być kontrolowana dla ważnego wnioskowania przyczynowego\n\nPrzykład badawczy:\n\nObserwacja: Spożycie kawy koreluje z chorobami serca\nPotencjalny czynnik zakłócający: Palenie (osoby pijące kawę częściej palą)\nPrawdziwe relacje:\nPalenie → Choroby serca (przyczynowa)\nPalenie → Spożycie kawy (związek)\nKawa → Choroby serca (pozorna bez kontroli palenia)\n\n\n\nJak Identyfikować Związki Przyczynowe\n\nRandomizowane badania kontrolowane (RCTs): Losowy przydział przerywa wpływ czynników zakłócających\nEksperymenty naturalne (natural experiments): Zdarzenia zewnętrzne tworzą „jakby” losową zmienność\nKontrola statystyczna: Włączenie czynników zakłócających do modeli regresji\nZmienne instrumentalne (instrumental variables): Znalezienie zmiennych wpływających na X, ale nie bezpośrednio na Y\n\n\n\nKluczowy Wniosek\nZnalezienie korelacji jest łatwe. Ustalenie przyczynowości jest trudne.

Przykład: Możemy powiedzieć, że 45% mieszkańców urodziło się lokalnie, ale nie możemy obliczyć „średniego miejsca urodzenia”.\nSkala porządkowa (Ordinal Scale): Kolejność ma znaczenie, ale różnice między wartościami niekoniecznie są równe. Przykład: Różnica między „złym” a „przeciętnym” zdrowiem może nie równać się różnicy między „dobrym” a „doskonałym” zdrowiem.\nSkala interwałowa (Interval Scale): Równe interwały między wartościami, ale brak prawdziwego punktu zerowego. Przykład: Temperatura w stopniach Celsjusza — różnica między 20°C a 30°C równa się różnicy między 30°C a 40°C, ale 0°C nie oznacza „braku temperatury”.\nSkala ilorazowa (Ratio Scale): Równe interwały z prawdziwym punktem zerowym, umożliwiające wszystkie operacje matematyczne. Przykład: Dochód — 40 000 zł to dwa razy więcej niż 20 000 zł, a 0 zł oznacza brak dochodu.",

Zrozumienie relacji między tymi terminami jest niezbędne dla właściwego rozumowania statystycznego.\n\nParametr\nParametr to liczbowa charakterystyka populacji. Parametry są zazwyczaj nieznane, ponieważ nie możemy zmierzyć całej populacji. Są to wartości stałe (nie losowe), ale nieznane nam. Oznaczamy parametry literami greckimi.\nPowszechne parametry demograficzne:\n\n\\mu (mi): Średni wiek populacji. Na przykład, prawdziwy średni wiek wszystkich Europejczyków.\n\\sigma^2 (sigma kwadrat): Wariancja populacji w dochodzie we wszystkich gospodarstwach domowych w Brazylii.\np: Proporcja populacji. Na przykład, prawdziwa proporcja wszystkich dorosłych w Japonii, którzy są małżonkami.\n\\beta (beta): Współczynnik regresji. Prawdziwa relacja między wykształceniem a płodnością w populacji.\n\\lambda (lambda): Parametr stopy. Prawdziwa stopa migracji z obszarów wiejskich do miejskich.\n\nPrzykład: Prawdziwy średni wiek przy pierwszym porodzie dla wszystkich kobiet we Francji, które urodziły dziecko w 2023 roku, jest parametrem. Nazwijmy go \\mu = 31,2 lat. Nie znamy tej wartości bez zmierzenia każdego pojedynczego porodu.\n\n\nStatystyka\nStatystyka to liczbowa charakterystyka obliczona z danych z próby.

Używamy łacińskich liter dla statystyk.\nPowszechne statystyki z próby:\n\n\\bar{x} (x z kreską): Średnia wieku z próby z badania 1000 osób\ns^2: Wariancja dochodu z próby z 500 ankietowanych gospodarstw\n\\hat{p} (p z daszkiem): Proporcja małżonków z próby z badania\nr: Korelacja z próby między wykształceniem a dochodem\nb: Współczynnik regresji z próby\n\nPrzykład: Z próby 500 urodzeń we Francji obliczamy średni wiek przy pierwszym porodzie z próby \\bar{x} = 30,9 lat. To jest nasza statystyka. Inna próba może dać \\bar{x} = 31,4 lat.\n\n\nRelacja między parametrami a statystykami\nPomyśl o tej relacji jak o próbie zrozumienia głębokości jeziora:\n\nParametr: Prawdziwa średnia głębokość jeziora (nieznana, stała)\nStatystyka: Średnia głębokość z kilku punktów pomiarowych (znana, zmienia się z różnymi próbami)\nEstymacja: Używanie naszych pomiarów do zgadywania prawdziwej średniej głębokości\n\n\n\nEstymator\nEstymator to reguła lub formuła do obliczania oszacowania parametru populacji z danych z próby. Estymator to funkcja, która odwzorowuje dane z próby na oszacowania parametrów.\nWłaściwości dobrych estymatorów:\nNieobciążoność (Unbiasedness): Średnio estymator równa się prawdziwej wartości parametru. Gdybyśmy powtórzyli próbkowanie wiele razy, średnia wszystkich naszych oszacowań równałaby się prawdziwemu parametrowi.\nPrzykład: Średnia z próby \\bar{x} jest nieobciążonym estymatorem średniej populacji \\mu. Gdybyśmy wzięli 1000 różnych prób i obliczyli 1000 średnich z prób, ich średnia byłaby bardzo bliska \\mu.\nZgodność (Consistency): Gdy wielkość próby wzrasta, estymator zbiega się do prawdziwej wartości parametru.\nPrzykład: Z n=10, nasze oszacowanie średniego dochodu może być oddalone o 5000 zł. Z n=1000, możemy być oddaleni tylko o 500 zł. Z n=100 000, możemy być oddaleni tylko o 50 zł.\nEfektywność (Efficiency): Wśród nieobciążonych estymatorów, ten z najmniejszą wariancją. Średnia z próby jest bardziej efektywna niż mediana z próby do estymowania średniej populacji rozkładu normalnego.\nPowszechne estymatory:\n\nŚrednia z próby jako estymator średniej populacji: \\bar{x} = \\frac{\\sum x_i}{n}\nProporcja z próby jako estymator proporcji populacji: \\hat{p} = \\frac{x}{n} (gdzie x to liczba sukcesów)\nWariancja z próby jako estymator wariancji populacji: s^2 = \\frac{\\sum(x_i - \\bar{x})^2}{n-1}\n\nUwaga: Dzielimy przez (n-1), a nie n dla wariancji z próby, aby uczynić ją nieobciążoną — to się nazywa korekta Bessela.\n\n\nEstimand\nEstimand to konkretny parametr populacji, który chcemy oszacować. To cel naszej procedury estymacji. Jasna specyfikacja estimandu jest kluczowa dla właściwego wnioskowania statystycznego i unikania błędnej interpretacji.\nPrzykłady jasno zdefiniowanych estimandów:\n\n„Mediana dochodu gospodarstwa domowego dla wszystkich gospodarstw w Kalifornii na dzień 1 stycznia 2024”\n„Różnica w oczekiwanej długości życia między mężczyznami a kobietami urodzonymi w Szwecji w 2023 roku”\n„Proporcja wszystkich dorosłych w wieku 25-34 lat w obszarach miejskich, którzy ukończyli edukację wyższą”\n\nDlaczego precyzyjna definicja estimandu ma znaczenie:\nRozważ badanie „stopy bezrobocia”. Estimand musi określić:\n\nKto liczy się jako bezrobotny? (Aktywnie poszukujący pracy? Zniechęceni pracownicy?)\nJaki zakres wieku? (15+? 16-64?)\nJaki obszar geograficzny?\nJaki okres czasu?\n\nRóżne definicje prowadzą do różnych liczb. Amerykańskie Biuro Statystyki Pracy publikuje sześć różnych stóp bezrobocia (U-1 do U-6) na podstawie różnych definicji.\n\n\nOszacowanie (Estimate)\nOszacowanie to konkretna wartość numeryczna obliczona przez zastosowanie estymatora do obserwowanych danych. To nasze najlepsze przypuszczenie o prawdziwej wartości parametru na podstawie dostępnych informacji.\nPrzykład kompletnego procesu:\n\nEstimand (cel): Proporcja wszystkich dorosłych Amerykanów, którzy popierają działalność prezydenta\nParametr (prawdziwa nieznana wartość): p = 0,42 (42%, ale tego nie wiemy)\nEstymator (metoda): Proporcja z próby \\hat{p} = \\frac{x}{n} gdzie x to liczba popierających, a n to wielkość próby\nPróba: Ankietujemy 1500 losowo wybranych dorosłych, 650 popiera\nOszacowanie (obliczona wartość): \\hat{p} = \\frac{650}{1500} = 0,433 (43,3%)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEstimandy: Co dokładnie próbujemy oszacować?\n\n\n\nEstimand to konkretna wielkość, którą chcemy oszacować — na co celujemy naszą analizą statystyczną. Choć często jest to parametr populacji, estimandy mogą być bardziej złożone.\nPrzykłady różnych estimandów:\nProsty estimand parametru: Średni dochód populacji (\\mu) Porównawczy estimand: Różnica w średnim dochodzie między dwiema grupami (\\mu_1 - \\mu_2) Przyczynowy estimand: Średni efekt leczenia programu szkoleniowego na zarobki Warunkowy estimand: Oczekiwana frekwencja wyborcza przy konkretnych warunkach pogodowych\n\nKompletna struktura\nZrozumienie wnioskowania statystycznego wymaga rozróżnienia między tymi powiązanymi, ale odrębnymi pojęciami:\n\nParametr populacji: Prawdziwa charakterystyka populacji (np. \\mu)\nEstimand: Konkretna wielkość, którą chcemy oszacować (często, ale nie zawsze, parametr)\nEstymator: Metoda obliczania naszego oszacowania (np. średnia z próby)\nOszacowanie: Rzeczywista liczba, którą obliczamy z naszych danych\n\nPrzykład w kontekście:\n\nParametr: Prawdziwa średnia frekwencja wyborcza we wszystkich wyborach (\\mu)\nEstimand: Oczekiwana różnica frekwencji między deszczowymi a słonecznymi dniami wyborów (\\mu_{\\text{deszczowy}} - \\mu_{\\text{słoneczny}})\nEstymator: Różnica między średnimi z prób z deszczowych i słonecznych wyborów\nOszacowanie: 3,2 punkty procentowe niższa frekwencja w deszczowe dni\n\nTa struktura pomaga wyjaśnić dokładnie, na jakie pytanie odpowiadamy i zapewnia, że nasze metody są zgodne z naszymi celami badawczymi.",

    "text": "2.7 Próbkowanie i metody próbkowania\nPróbkowanie to proces wyboru podzbioru jednostek z populacji w celu oszacowania charakterystyk całej populacji. Sposób, w jaki próbkujemy, głęboko wpływa na to, co możemy wywnioskować z naszych danych.\n\nOperat losowania (Sampling Frame)\nZanim omówimy metody, musimy zrozumieć operant losowania — listę lub urządzenie, z którego pobieramy naszą próbę. Operant powinien idealnie obejmować każdego członka populacji dokładnie raz.\nPowszechne operanty losowania:\n\nListy wyborcze (dla dorosłych obywateli)\nKsiążki telefoniczne (coraz bardziej problematyczne z powodu telefonów komórkowych i numerów nienotowanych)\nListy adresowe z poczty\nRejestracje urodzeń (dla noworodków)\nListy zapisów do szkół (dla dzieci)\nRejestry podatkowe (dla osób zarabiających)\nZdjęcia satelitarne (dla mieszkań w odległych obszarach)\n\nProblemy z operatami losowania:\n\nNiepełne pokrycie (Undercoverage): Operat pomija członków populacji (bezdomni nieobecni na listach adresowych)\nNadmierne pokrycie (Overcoverage): Operat obejmuje osoby spoza populacji (zmarli nadal na listach wyborców)\nDuplikacja: Ta sama jednostka pojawia się wielokrotnie (osoby z wieloma numerami telefonów)\nGrupowanie (Clustering): Wielu członków populacji na jednostkę operatu (wiele rodzin pod jednym adresem)\n\n\n\nMetody próbkowania probabilistycznego\nPróbkowanie probabilistyczne daje każdemu członkowi populacji znane, niezerowe prawdopodobieństwo selekcji. To pozwala nam dokonywać wnioskowań statystycznych o populacji.\n\nProste losowanie (Simple Random Sampling - SRS)\nKażda możliwa próba o wielkości n ma równe prawdopodobieństwo selekcji. To złoty standard teorii statystycznej, ale często niepraktyczny dla dużych populacji.\nJak to działa:\n\nPonumeruj każdą jednostkę w populacji od 1 do N\nUżyj liczb losowych do wybrania n jednostek\nKażda jednostka ma prawdopodobieństwo n/N selekcji\n\nPrzykład: Aby wybrać próbę 50 uczniów ze szkoły liczącej 1000:\n\nPrzypisz każdemu uczniowi numer od 1 do 1000\nWygeneruj 50 losowych liczb między 1 a 1000\nWybierz uczniów z tymi numerami\n\nZalety:\n\nStatystycznie optymalny\nŁatwy do analizy\nNie wymaga dodatkowych informacji o populacji\n\nWady:\n\nWymaga kompletnego operatu losowania\nMoże być kosztowny (wybrane jednostki mogą być daleko od siebie)\nMoże nie reprezentować dobrze ważnych podgrup przez przypadek\n\n\n\nLosowanie systematyczne (Systematic Sampling)\nWybierz co k-ty element z uporządkowanego operatu losowania, gdzie k = N/n (interwał próbkowania).\nJak to działa:\n\nOblicz interwał próbkowania k = N/n\nLosowo wybierz punkt początkowy między 1 a k\nWybierz co k-tą jednostkę następnie\n\nPrzykład: Aby wybrać próbę 100 domów z 5000 na liście ulic:\n\nk = 5000/100 = 50\nLosowy start: 23\nPróba gospodarstw domowych: 23, 73, 123, 173, 223…\n\nZalety:\n\nProste do wdrożenia w terenie\nRozprzestrzenia próbę w całej populacji\n\nWady:\n\nMoże wprowadzić obciążenie, jeśli jest okresowość w operacie\n\nPrzykład ukrytej okresowości: Próbkowanie co 10. mieszkania w budynkach, gdzie mieszkania narożne (numery kończące się na 0) są wszystkie większe. To zawyżyłoby nasze oszacowanie średniej wielkości mieszkania.\n\n\nLosowanie warstwowe (Stratified Sampling)\nPodziel populację na jednorodne podgrupy (warstwy) przed próbkowaniem. Próbkuj niezależnie w każdej warstwie.\nJak to działa:\n\nPodziel populację na nienachodzące warstwy\nPróbkuj niezależnie z każdej warstwy\nPołącz wyniki z odpowiednimi wagami\n\nPrzykład: Badanie dochodu w mieście z odrębnymi dzielnicami:\n\nWarstwa 1: Dzielnica wysokich dochodów (10% populacji) - próba 100\nWarstwa 2: Dzielnica średnich dochodów (60% populacji) - próba 600\nWarstwa 3: Dzielnica niskich dochodów (30% populacji) - próba 300\n\nTypy alokacji:\nProporcjonalna: Wielkość próby w każdej warstwie proporcjonalna do wielkości warstwy\n\nJeśli warstwa ma 20% populacji, dostaje 20% próby\n\nOptymalna (Neymana): Większe próby z bardziej zmiennych warstw\n\nJeśli dochód bardziej się różni w obszarach wysokich dochodów, próbkuj tam więcej\n\nRówna: Ta sama wielkość próby na warstwę niezależnie od wielkości populacji\n\nPrzydatna, gdy porównywanie warstw jest głównym celem\n\nZalety:\n\nZapewnia reprezentację wszystkich podgrup\nMoże znacznie zwiększyć precyzję\nPozwala na różne metody próbkowania w warstwie\nDostarcza oszacowania dla każdej warstwy\n\nWady:\n\nWymaga informacji do utworzenia warstw\nMoże być trudna do badania\n\n\n\nLosowanie grupowe (Cluster Sampling)\nWybierz grupy (klastry) zamiast jednostek. Często używane, gdy populacja jest naturalnie pogrupowana lub gdy utworzenie kompletnego operanta jest trudne.\nJednostopniowe losowanie grupowe:\n\nPodziel populację na klastry\nLosowo wybierz niektóre klastry\nUwzględnij wszystkie jednostki z wybranych klastrów\n\nDwustopniowe losowanie grupowe:\n\nLosowo wybierz klastry (Pierwotne Jednostki Losowania)\nW wybranych klastrach losowo wybierz jednostki (Wtórne Jednostki Losowania)\n\nPrzykład: Badanie gospodarstw wiejskich w dużym kraju:\n\nEtap 1: Losowo wybierz 50 wsi z 1000 wsi\nEtap 2: W każdej wybranej wsi losowo wybierz 20 gospodarstw\nCałkowita próba: 50 × 20 = 1000 gospodarstw\n\nPrzykład wielostopniowy: Krajowe badanie zdrowotne:\n\nEtap 1: Wybierz województwa\nEtap 2: Wybierz powiaty w wybranych województwach\nEtap 3: Wybierz obwody spisowe w wybranych powiatach\nEtap 4: Wybierz gospodarstwa w wybranych obwodach\nEtap 5: Wybierz jednego dorosłego w wybranych gospodarstwach\n\nZalety:\n\nNie wymaga kompletnej listy populacji\nRedukuje koszty podróży (jednostki zgrupowane geograficznie)\nMoże używać różnych metod na różnych etapach\nNaturalne dla populacji hierarchicznych\n\nWady:\n\nMniej statystycznie efektywne niż SRS\nZłożona estymacja wariancji\nWiększe próby potrzebne dla tej samej precyzji\n\nEfekt projektu (Design Effect): Losowanie grupowe zazwyczaj wymaga większych prób niż SRS. Efekt projektu (DEFF) kwantyfikuje to:\n\\text{DEFF} = \\frac{\\text{Wariancja(próba grupowa)}}{\\text{Wariancja(SRS)}}\nJeśli DEFF = 2, potrzebujesz dwukrotnie większej próby, aby osiągnąć taką samą precyzję jak SRS.\n\n\n\nMetody próbkowania nieprobabilistycznego\nPróbkowanie nieprobabilistyczne nie gwarantuje znanych prawdopodobieństw selekcji. Choć ogranicza wnioskowanie statystyczne, te metody mogą być konieczne lub przydatne w pewnych sytuacjach.\n\nPróbkowanie wygodne (Convenience Sampling)\nSelekcja oparta wyłącznie na łatwości dostępu. Brak próby reprezentacji.\nPrzykłady:\n\nAnkietowanie studentów w twojej klasie o nawykach nauki\nWywiadowanie ludzi w centrum handlowym o preferencjach konsumenckich\nAnkiety online, w których każdy może uczestniczyć\nBadania medyczne używające wolontariuszy, którzy odpowiadają na ogłoszenia\n\nKiedy może być akceptowalne:\n\nBadania pilotażowe do testowania instrumentów ankietowych\nBadania eksploracyjne do identyfikacji problemów\nGdy badane procesy uważa się za uniwersalne\n\nGłówne problemy:\n\nBrak podstaw do wnioskowania o populacji\nPrawdopodobne poważne obciążenie selekcyjne\nWyniki mogą być całkowicie mylące\n\nPrawdziwy przykład: Sondaż prezydencki Literary Digest z 1936 roku ankietował 2,4 miliona osób (ogromna próba!), ale używał książek telefonicznych i członkostwa w klubach jako operantów podczas Wielkiego Kryzysu, dramatycznie nadreprezentując bogatych wyborców i niepoprawnie przewidując, że Landon pokona Roosevelta.\n\n\nPróbkowanie celowe (Purposive/Judgmental Sampling)\nCelowy wybór konkretnych przypadków oparty na osądzie badacza o tym, co jest „typowe” lub „interesujące”.\nPrzykłady:\n\nWybór „typowych” wsi do reprezentowania obszarów wiejskich\nWybór konkretnych grup wiekowych do badania rozwojowego\nWybór skrajnych przypadków do zrozumienia zakresu zmienności\nWybór przypadków bogatych w informacje do dogłębnego badania\n\nTypy próbkowania celowego:\nTypowy przypadek: Wybierz przeciętne lub normalne przykłady\n\nBadanie „typowych” polskich przedmieść\n\nSkrajny/dewiacyjny przypadek: Wybierz niezwykłe przykłady\n\nBadanie wsi z niezwykle niską śmiertelnością niemowląt, aby zrozumieć czynniki sukcesu\n\nMaksymalna zmienność: Celowo wybierz różnorodne przypadki\n\nWybór różnych szkół (miejskich/wiejskich, bogatych/biednych, dużych/małych) do badań edukacyjnych\n\nPrzypadek krytyczny: Wybierz przypadki, które będą definitywne\n\n„Jeśli to nie działa tutaj, nie zadziała nigdzie”\n\nKiedy jest przydatne:\n\nBadania jakościowe skupiające się na głębi nad szerokością\nGdy badane są rzadkie populacje\nOgraniczenia zasobów poważnie limitują wielkość próby\nFazy eksploracyjne badań\n\nProblemy:\n\nCałkowicie zależne od osądu badacza\nNiemożliwe wnioskowanie statystyczne\nRóżni badacze mogą wybrać różne „typowe” przypadki\n\n\n\nPróbkowanie kwotowe (Quota Sampling)\nSelekcja w celu dopasowania proporcji populacji w kluczowych charakterystykach. Jak losowanie warstwowe, ale bez losowej selekcji w grupach.\nJak działa próbkowanie kwotowe:\n\nZidentyfikuj kluczowe charakterystyki (wiek, płeć, rasa, wykształcenie)\nOkreśl proporcje populacji dla tych charakterystyk\nUstaw kwoty dla każdej kombinacji\nAnkieterzy wypełniają kwoty używając metod wygodnych\n\nSzczegółowy przykład: Sondaż polityczny z kwotami:\nProporcje populacji:\n\nMężczyzna 18-34: 15%\nMężczyzna 35-54: 20%\nMężczyzna 55+: 15%\nKobieta 18-34: 16%\nKobieta 35-54: 19%\nKobieta 55+: 15%\n\nDla próby 1000:\n\nWywiad z 150 mężczyznami w wieku 18-34\nWywiad z 200 mężczyznami w wieku 35-54\nI tak dalej…\n\nAnkieterzy mogą stać na rogach ulic, podchodząc do osób, które wydają się pasować do potrzebnych kategorii, aż kwoty zostaną wypełnione.\nDlaczego jest popularne w badaniach rynkowych:\n\nSzybsze niż próbkowanie probabilistyczne\nTańsze (brak ponownych kontaktów dla konkretnych osób)\nZapewnia reprezentację demograficzną\nNie wymaga operatu losowania\n\nDlaczego jest problematyczne dla wnioskowania statystycznego:\nUkryte obciążenie selekcyjne: Ankieterzy podchodzą do osób, które wyglądają na przystępne, dobrze mówią językiem, nie spieszą się — systematycznie wykluczając pewne typy w każdej komórce kwotowej.\nPrzykład obciążenia: Ankieter wypełniający kwotę dla „kobiet 18-34” może podchodzić do kobiet w centrum handlowym we wtorek po południu, systematycznie pomijając:\n\nKobiety pracujące w dni powszednie\nKobiety, których nie stać na zakupy w centrach handlowych\nKobiety z małymi dziećmi, które unikają centrów handlowych\nKobiety robiące zakupy online\n\nMimo że końcowa próba ma „właściwą” proporcję młodych kobiet, nie są one reprezentatywne dla wszystkich młodych kobiet.\nBrak miary błędu próbkowania: Bez prawdopodobieństw selekcji nie możemy obliczyć błędów standardowych ani przedziałów ufności.\nHistoryczna przestroga: Próbkowanie kwotowe było standardem w sondażach do wyborów prezydenckich w USA w 1948 roku, gdy sondaże używające próbkowania kwotowego niepoprawnie przewidziały, że Dewey pokona Trumana. Niepowodzenie doprowadziło do przyjęcia próbkowania probabilistycznego w sondażach.\n\n\nPróbkowanie kuli śnieżnej (Snowball Sampling)\nUczestnicy rekrutują dodatkowych uczestników ze swoich znajomych. Próba rośnie jak tocząca się kula śnieżna.\nJak to działa:\n\nZidentyfikuj początkowych uczestników (nasiona)\nPoproś ich o polecenie innych z wymaganymi charakterystykami\nPoproś nowych uczestników o dalsze polecenia\nKontynuuj, aż osiągnięta zostanie wielkość próby lub wyczerpią się polecenia\n\nPrzykład: Badanie nieudokumentowanych imigrantów:\n\nZacznij od 5 imigrantów, których możesz zidentyfikować\nKażdy poleca 3 innych, których zna\nTych 15 każdy poleca 2-3 innych\nKontynuuj, aż masz 100+ uczestników\n\nKiedy jest wartościowe:\nUkryte populacje: Grupy bez operantów losowania\n\nUżytkownicy narkotyków\nOsoby bezdomne\nOsoby z rzadkimi chorobami\nCzłonkowie ruchów podziemnych\n\nPopulacje połączone społecznie: Gdy relacje mają znaczenie\n\nBadanie efektów sieci społecznych\nBadanie transmisji chorób w społeczności\nZrozumienie dyfuzji informacji\n\nBadania zależne od zaufania: Gdy polecenia zwiększają uczestnictwo\n\nWrażliwe tematy, gdzie zaufanie jest niezbędne\nZamknięte społeczności podejrzliwe wobec obcych\n\nGłówne ograniczenia:\n\nPróby obciążone w kierunku osób współpracujących, dobrze połączonych\nOdizolowani członkowie populacji całkowicie pominięci\nWnioskowanie statystyczne generalnie niemożliwe\nMoże wzmacniać podziały społeczne (łańcuchy rzadko przekraczają granice społeczne)\n\nZaawansowana wersja — Próbkowanie sterowane przez respondentów (Respondent-Driven Sampling - RDS):\nPróbuje uczynić próbkowanie kuli śnieżnej bardziej rygorystycznym poprzez:\n\nŚledzenie, kto zrekrutował kogo\nOgraniczanie liczby poleceń na osobę\nWażenie na podstawie wielkości sieci\nUżywanie modeli matematycznych do korekty obciążenia\n\nNadal kontrowersyjne, czy RDS naprawdę pozwala na ważne wnioskowanie.",

Uczciwa moneta ma 50% szansy na wypadnięcie orła, ale poszczególne rzuty są nieprzewidywalne.\n\n# Symulacja rzutów monetą i pokazanie zbieżności\nset.seed(42)\nn_flips &lt;- 1000\nflips &lt;- rbinom(n_flips, 1, 0.5)  # 1 = orzeł, 0 = reszka\n\n# Obliczanie skumulowanej proporcji orłów\ncumulative_prop &lt;- cumsum(flips) / seq_along(flips)\n\n# Utworzenie ramki danych do wizualizacji\nlln_data &lt;- data.frame(\n  flip_number = 1:n_flips,\n  cumulative_proportion = cumulative_prop\n)\n\n# Wykres zbieżności\nggplot(lln_data, aes(x = flip_number, y = cumulative_proportion)) +\n  geom_line(color = \"steelblue\", alpha = 0.7) +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 0.5, color = \"red\", linetype = \"dashed\", size = 1) +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = c(0.45, 0.55), color = \"red\", linetype = \"dotted\", alpha = 0.7) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Prawo wielkich liczb: Proporcje rzutów monetą zbiegają do 0,5\",\n    x = \"Liczba rzutów monetą\",\n    y = \"Skumulowana proporcja orłów\",\n    caption = \"Czerwona linia przerywana = prawdziwe prawdopodobieństwo (0,5)\\nLinie kropkowane = zakres ±5%\"\n  ) +\n  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0.3, 0.7), breaks = seq(0.3, 0.7, 0.1)) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCo to pokazuje:\n\nPoczątkowe rzuty wykazują duże wahania (pierwsze 10 rzutów może dać 70% lub 30% orłów)\nW miarę dodawania kolejnych rzutów, proporcja stabilizuje się wokół 50%\n„Szum” poszczególnych wyników się uśrednia w czasie\n\n\n\nSformułowanie matematyczne\nNiech A oznacza zdarzenie nas interesujące (np. „orzeł w rzucie monetą”, „głos na partię X”, „suma kostek równa 7”). Jeśli P(A) = p i obserwujemy n niezależnych prób z tym samym rozkładem (i.i.d.), to częstość próbkowa zdarzenia A:\n\\hat{p}_n = \\frac{\\text{liczba wystąpień zdarzenia } A}{n}\nzbiega do p gdy n rośnie.\n\n\nPrzykłady w różnych kontekstach\nPrzykład z kostkami: Zdarzenie „suma = 7” przy dwóch kostkach ma prawdopodobieństwo 6/36 ≈ 16,7\\%, podczas gdy „suma = 4” ma 3/36 ≈ 8,3\\%. Przy wielu rzutach suma 7 pojawia się około dwa razy częściej niż suma 4.\nSondaże wyborcze: Jeśli poparcie populacyjne dla partii wynosi p, to przy losowym doborze próby o wielkości n obserwowana częstość \\hat{p}_n będzie zbliżać się do p w miarę wzrostu n (zakładając losowy dobór i niezależność prób).\nKontrola jakości: Jeśli 2% produktów jest wadliwych, to w dużych partiach około 2% zostanie uznanych za wadliwe (zakładając niezależną produkcję).\n\n\nDlaczego to ma znaczenie dla statystyki\nWniosek: Losowość stanowi podstawę wnioskowania statystycznego, przekształcając niepewność poszczególnych wyników w przewidywalne rozkłady dla estymatorów. Prawo wielkich liczb gwarantuje, że „szum” poszczególnych wyników się uśrednia, pozwalając nam:\n\nPrzewidywać długookresowe częstości\nKwantyfikować niepewność (marginesy błędu)\nWyciągać rzetelne wnioski z prób\nFormułować probabilistyczne stwierdzenia o populacjach\n\nTa zasada działa w sondażach, eksperymentach, a nawet w zjawiskach kwantowych (w interpretacji częstościowej).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCzym jest losowość? (*)\n\n\n\nW statystyce losowość to uporządkowany sposób opisu niepewności: pojedyncze wyniki są nieprzewidywalne, natomiast w długiej serii powtórzeń ujawniają się stabilne prawidłowości (np. częstości, średnie).\nDwie perspektywy\n\nPojedyncza realizacja — nie potrafimy przesądzić, jak zagłosuje konkretny wyborca w danym momencie.\n\nZbiorowość — możemy opisać odsetek wyborców głosujących na daną partię oraz związaną z nim niepewność estymacji.\n\nLosowość epistemiczna a ontologiczna\n\nEpistemiczna (związana z niewiedzą): wynik traktujemy jako losowy, ponieważ nie obserwujemy wszystkich determinant lub nie kontrolujemy warunków.\nPrzykłady:\n\ndecyzja pojedynczego wyborcy w sondażu (nie znamy pełnych motywacji),\nbłąd pomiaru w ankiecie (ograniczona precyzja, brak odpowiedzi),\nrzut monetą modelowany jako losowy, ponieważ drobne, nieobserwowalne różnice warunków początkowych determinują wynik.\n\nOntologiczna (wrodzona przypadkowość zjawiska): nawet pełna wiedza nie usuwa niepewności wyniku.\nPrzykłady:\n\nczas rozpadu promieniotwórczego atomu.\n\n\n\nZnaczenie losowości\n\nLosowe próbkowanie\n\nOgranicza systematyczny błąd doboru, dzięki czemu próba przypomina populację docelową (w średnim ujęciu / w wartości oczekiwanej).\nUmożliwia ilościowe ujęcie niepewności (np. margines błędu; pojęcie „przedziału ufności” omówimy później), pod warunkiem rzeczywiście losowego doboru i dobrego pokrycia populacji.\n\nLosowy przydział (eksperymenty)\n\nPrzerywa związek między przydziałem a innymi czynnikami, czyniąc grupy porównywalnymi średnio (zarówno pod względem cech obserwowalnych, jak i nieobserwowalnych).\nUmożliwia wiarygodne wnioskowanie przyczynowe (identyfikację średnich efektów przy standardowych założeniach).\n\n\n\n\nSiła losowego próbkowania\nZałóżmy, że losujemy próbę prostą o liczebności n=1000 wyborców i obserwujemy \\hat p = 0{,}55 (tj. 55% poparcia). Wówczas:\n\nNaszą najlepszą, jednowartościową oceną odsetka w populacji p jest \\hat p = 0{,}55.\nOrientacyjny „95\\% zakres wartości plauzybilnych” wokół \\hat p można przybliżyć wzorem \n\\hat p \\,\\pm\\, 2\\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat p(1-\\hat p)}{n}}\n\\;=\\;\n0{,}55 \\,\\pm\\, 2\\sqrt{\\frac{0{,}55\\cdot 0{,}45}{1000}}\n\\approx\n0{,}55 \\pm 0{,}031,\n czyli w przybliżeniu 52\\%\\text{–}58\\% (około \\pm 3{,}1 punktu procentowego, pp).\nSzerokość tego zakresu maleje wraz z liczebnością próby: \n\\text{szerokość} \\;\\propto\\; \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}}.\n Przykładowo, zwiększenie n z 1000 do 4000 mniej więcej zmniejsza błąd o połowę.\n\n\n\n2.9 Rozumienie różnych typów nieprzewidywalności\nNie wszystkie rodzaje niepewności są takie same. Zrozumienie różnych źródeł nieprzewidywalności pomaga w wyborze odpowiednich metod statystycznych i prawidłowej interpretacji wyników.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPojęcie\nCzym jest?\nŹródło nieprzewidywalności\nPrzykład\n\n\n\n\nLosowość (randomness)\nPoszczególne wyniki są niepewne, ale rozkład prawdopodobieństwa jest znany lub modelowany.\nFluktuacje między realizacjami; brak informacji o konkretnym wyniku.\nRzut kostką, rzut monetą, próba sondażowa\n\n\nChaos\nDynamika deterministyczna bardzo wrażliwa na warunki początkowe (efekt motyla).\nNiewielkie różnice początkowe szybko narastają → duże rozbieżności trajektorii.\nPrognoza pogody, podwójne wahadło, dynamika populacyjna\n\n\nEntropia\nMiara niepewności/rozproszenia (teorioinformacyjna lub termodynamiczna).\nWiększa gdy wyniki są bardziej równomiernie rozłożone (mniej informacji predykcyjnej).\nEntropia Shannona w kompresji danych\n\n\n„Przypadkowość” (potoczne)\nOdczuwany brak porządku bez wyraźnego modelu; mieszanka mechanizmów.\nBrak uporządkowanego opisu lub stabilnych reguł; nakładające się procesy.\nWzorce ruchu, trendy w mediach społecznościowych\n\n\nLosowość kwantowa (quantum randomness)\nPojedynczy wynik nie jest zdeterminowany; tylko rozkład jest określony (reguła Borna).\nFundamentalna (ontologiczna) nieokreśloność poszczególnych pomiarów.\nPomiar spinu elektronu, polaryzacja fotonu\n\n\n\n\nKluczowe rozróżnienia dla praktyki statystycznej\nChaos deterministyczny ≠ losowość statystyczna: System chaotyczny jest w pełni deterministyczny, ale praktycznie nieprzewidywalny z powodu ekstremalnej wrażliwości na warunki początkowe. Losowość statystyczna modeluje natomiast niepewność poprzez rozkłady prawdopodobieństwa, gdzie poszczególne wyniki są rzeczywiście niepewne.\nDlaczego to ważne: W statystyce zazwyczaj modelujemy zjawiska jako procesy losowe, zakładając, że możemy określić rozkłady prawdopodobieństwa, nawet gdy poszczególne wyniki są nieprzewidywalne. To założenie stanowi podstawę większości wnioskowań statystycznych.\n\n\nMechanika kwantowa i fundamentalna losowość\nW interpretacji kopenhaskiej losowość jest fundamentalna (ontologiczna): pojedynczy wynik nie może być przewidziany, ale rozkład prawdopodobieństwa jest dany przez regułę Borna.\nTo reprezentuje prawdziwą losowość na najbardziej podstawowym poziomie natury, nie tylko naszą ignorancję czynników determinujących.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCentralne Twierdzenie Graniczne\nRozkład średnich z prób zbliża się do rozkładu normalnego, gdy wielkość próby wzrasta, niezależnie od rozkładu populacji.\nDlaczego to ma znaczenie: Nawet jeśli dochód jest bardzo skośny, średni dochód z prób 100+ osób podąża za przybliżonym rozkładem normalnym, pozwalając nam używać przedziałów ufności opartych na rozkładzie normalnym.",

To jest kluczowe pytanie, na które pomaga odpowiedzieć istotność statystyczna (wnioskowanie statystyczne).\nIstotność statystyczna to miara (p-value) tego, na ile możemy być pewni, że wzorce obserwowane w naszej próbie nie są dziełem przypadku. Gdy wynik jest statystycznie istotny (zwykle przyjmujemy p-value &lt; 0.05), oznacza to, że prawdopodobieństwo uzyskania takich danych przy braku rzeczywistego efektu jest bardzo niskie.\nIstotność statystyczna pomaga nam rozróżnić między rzeczywistymi zjawiskami a przypadkowymi fluktuacjami w danych.

Jaka jest wartość p?\nObliczenie: Jeśli moneta byłaby uczciwa, prawdopodobieństwo uzyskania 8 lub więcej orłów wynosi:\np = P(≥8 \\text{ orłów w 10 rzutach}) \\approx 0.055 \\approx 5.5\\%\nP(X \\geq 8) = \\sum_{k=8}^{10} \\binom{10}{k} 0,5^{10} = \\frac{56}{1024} \\approx 0,0547\nInterpretacja: Jest 5,5% szans na uzyskanie tak ekstremalnych wyników z uczciwą monetą. To trochę nietypowe, ale nie jest to skrajnie nieprawdopodobny wynik.\n\n\n3. Formalna Definicja\nWartość p to prawdopodobieństwo uzyskania wyników co najmniej tak ekstremalnych jak zaobserwowane, zakładając że hipoteza zerowa jest prawdziwa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nCzęsty Błąd: Wartość p NIE jest prawdopodobieństwem, że hipoteza zerowa jest prawdziwa! Zakłada ona, że hipoteza zerowa jest prawdziwa i mówi, jak nietypowe byłyby twoje dane w tym świecie (w którym H_0 jest prawdziwa).",

Znaleźliśmy jego DNA. Zatem istnieje 99% pewności, że jest winny!”\nTo BŁĄD! Prokurator pomylił:\n\nP(Dowód | Niewinny) = 0,01 ← To, co wiemy\nP(Niewinny | Dowód) = ? ← To, co chcemy wiedzieć (ale nie możemy tego wywnioskować z samej wartości p!)\n\n\nGdy otrzymujemy p = 0,01, kuszące jest myślenie:\n❌ ŹLE: “Jest tylko 1% szans, że hipoteza zerowa jest prawdziwa”\n❌ ŹLE: “Jest 99% szans, że nasze leczenie działa”\n✅ DOBRZE: “Jeśli hipoteza zerowa byłaby prawdziwa, istnieje tylko 1% szans, że zobaczylibyśmy tak ekstremalne dane”\n\n\nDlaczego to ważne: Prosty przykład testu medycznego\nWyobraź sobie test na rzadką chorobę, który jest dokładny w 99%:\n\nJeśli masz chorobę, test jest pozytywny w 99% przypadków\nJeśli nie masz choroby, test jest negatywny w 99% przypadków (czyli 1% wyników fałszywie pozytywnych)\n\nOto klucz: Załóżmy, że tylko 1 na 1000 osób faktycznie ma tę chorobę.\nPrzetestujmy 10 000 osób:\n\n10 osób ma chorobę → 10 ma pozytywny wynik testu (w zaokrągleniu)\n9 990 osób nie ma choroby → około 100 ma pozytywny wynik przez pomyłkę (1% z 9 990)\nŁącznie pozytywnych testów: 110\n\nJeśli twój test jest pozytywny, jakie jest prawdopodobieństwo, że rzeczywiście masz chorobę?\n\nTylko 10 ze 110 pozytywnych testów to prawdziwe przypadki\nTo około 9%, nie 99%!\n\n\n\nAnalogia do badań naukowych\nTo samo dzieje się w badaniach:\n\nGdy testujemy wiele hipotez (jak testowanie wielu potencjalnych leków)\nWiększość nie działa (jak większość ludzi nie ma rzadkiej choroby)\nNawet przy “istotnych” wynikach (jak pozytywny test), większość odkryć może być fałszywie pozytywna\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nWartość p mówi ci, jak zaskakujące byłyby twoje dane, GDYBY hipoteza zerowa była prawdziwa.

    "section": "2.13 Wprowadzenie do analizy regresji: Modelowanie relacji między zmiennymi",
    "text": "2.13 Wprowadzenie do analizy regresji: Modelowanie relacji między zmiennymi\nJednym z najważniejszych narzędzi w analizie statystycznej jest analiza regresji — metoda zrozumienia i kwantyfikacji relacji między zmiennymi.\nPodstawowa idea jest prosta: Jak jedna rzecz odnosi się do drugiej i czy możemy użyć tej relacji do dokonywania przewidywań (np. jak liczba lat nauki wpływa na dochody?)?\n\nW jednym zdaniu: Regresja pomaga nam zrozumieć, jak różne zjawiska są ze sobą powiązane w skomplikowanym świecie, gdzie wszystko wpływa na wszystko inne.\n\n\nCzym jest analiza regresji?\nWyobraź sobie, że jesteś ciekawy relacji między wykształceniem a dochodem. Zauważasz, że ludzie z większym wykształceniem zwykle zarabiają więcej pieniędzy, ale chcesz zrozumieć tę relację bardziej precyzyjnie:\n\nO ile średnio każdy dodatkowy rok edukacji zwiększa dochód?\nJak silna jest ta relacja?\nCzy są inne czynniki, które powinniśmy rozważyć?\nCzy możemy przewidzieć prawdopodobny dochód kogoś, jeśli znamy jego poziom wykształcenia?\n\nAnaliza regresji w sposób systematyczny odpowiada na te pytania — szuka najlepiej dopasowanego opisu relacji między zmiennymi.\n\n\nZmienne i Zmienność\nZmienna to każda charakterystyka, która może przyjmować różne wartości dla różnych jednostek obserwacji. W naukach politycznych:\n\nJednostki analizy: Kraje, osoby, wybory, polityki, lata\nZmienne: PKB, preferencje wyborcze, wskaźnik demokracji, wystąpienie konfliktu\n\n\n💡 Mówiąc Prosto: Zmienna to wszystko, co się zmienia. Gdyby wszyscy głosowali tak samo, “preferencje wyborcze” nie byłyby zmienną - byłyby stałą. Badamy zmienne, ponieważ chcemy zrozumieć, dlaczego rzeczy się różnią.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nRozważmy typowy nagłówek prasowy przed wyborami: „Poparcie dla kandydata Kowalskiego sięga 68%.” Najprawdopodobniej wyciągniesz wniosek, że Kowalski ma dobre perspektywy wyborcze—nie gwarantowane zwycięstwo, ale silną pozycję. Intuicyjnie rozumiesz, że wyższe poparcie zwykle przekłada się na lepsze wyniki wyborcze, nawet jeśli związek ten nie jest doskonały.\nTa intuicyjna ocena ilustruje istotę analizy regresji. Wykorzystałeś jedną informację (wskaźnik poparcia), aby przewidzieć inny wynik (sukces wyborczy). Co więcej, rozpoznałeś zarówno związek między tymi zmiennymi, jak i niepewność związaną z twoją prognozą.\nChociaż takie nieformalne rozumowanie dobrze nam służy w życiu codziennym, ma istotne ograniczenia. O ile lepsze są szanse Kowalskiego przy 68% poparciu w porównaniu do 58%? Co się dzieje, gdy musimy jednocześnie uwzględnić wiele czynników—poparcie, sytuację gospodarczą i status urzędującego kandydata? Jak pewni powinniśmy być naszych prognoz?\nAnaliza regresji dostarcza systematycznych ram do odpowiedzi na te pytania. Przekształca nasze intuicyjne rozumienie związków w precyzyjne modele matematyczne, które można testować i udoskonalać. Dzięki analizie regresji badacze mogą:\n\nGenerować precyzyjne prognozy: Wyjść poza ogólne oceny ku konkretnym liczbowym szacunkom—na przykład przewidywać nie tylko, że Kowalski „prawdopodobnie wygra”, ale oszacować oczekiwany procent głosów i zakres prawdopodobnych wyników.\nOkreślić, które czynniki są najważniejsze: Ustalić względne znaczenie różnych zmiennych—być może odkrywając, że warunki gospodarcze wpływają na wybory silniej niż wskaźniki poparcia.\nOkreślić ilościowo niepewność prognoz: Dokładnie zmierzyć, jak pewni powinniśmy być naszych przewidywań, rozróżniając między niemal pewnymi wynikami a edukowanymi przypuszczeniami.\nTestować propozycje teoretyczne danymi empirycznymi: Ocenić, czy nasze przekonania o związkach przyczynowo-skutkowych sprawdzają się, gdy testujemy je systematycznie na wielu obserwacjach.\n\n\nW istocie analiza regresji systematyzuje rozpoznawanie wzorców, które wykonujemy intuicyjnie, dostarczając narzędzi do tego, aby nasze prognozy były dokładniejsze, nasze porównania bardziej znaczące, a nasze wnioski bardziej wiarygodne.\n\n\n\nModel Podstawowy\nModel reprezentuje obiekt, osobę lub system w sposób informatywny. Modele dzielą się na reprezentacje fizyczne (takie jak modele architektoniczne) i abstrakcyjne (takie jak równania matematyczne opisujące dynamikę atmosfery).\nRdzeń myślenia statystycznego można wyrazić jako:\nY = f(X) + \\text{błąd}\nTo równanie stwierdza, że nasz wynik (Y) równa się jakiejś funkcji naszych predyktorów (X), plus nieprzewidywalna zmienność.\nSkładniki:\n\nY = Zmienna zależna (zjawisko, które chcemy wyjaśnić)\nX = Zmienna(e) niezależna(e) (czynniki wyjaśniające)\nf() = Związek funkcyjny (często zakładamy liniowy)\nbłąd (\\epsilon) = Niewyjaśniona zmienność\n\n\n💡 Co To Naprawdę Oznacza: Można to porównać do przepisu kulinarnego. Ocena z przedmiotu (Y) zależy od godzin nauki (X), ale nie doskonale. Dwóch studentów uczących się 10 godzin może otrzymać różne oceny z powodu stresu przed egzaminem, wcześniejszej wiedzy czy po prostu szczęścia (składnik błędu). Regresja znajduje średni związek.\n\nTen model stanowi podstawę całej analizy statystycznej - od prostych korelacji po złożone algorytmy uczenia maszynowego.\nRegresja pomaga odpowiedzieć na fundamentalne pytania takie jak:\n\nO ile edukacja zwiększa uczestnictwo polityczne?\nJakie czynniki przewidują sukces wyborczy?\nCzy instytucje demokratyczne promują wzrost gospodarczy?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPodstawowa idea: Rysowanie najlepszej linii przez punkty\n\nProsta regresja liniowa (Simple Linear Regression)\nZacznijmy od najprostszego przypadku: relacji między dwiema zmiennymi. Załóżmy, że rysujemy wykształcenie (lata nauki) na osi x i roczny dochód na osi y dla 100 osób. Zobaczylibyśmy chmurę punktów, a regresja znajduje prostą linię, która najlepiej reprezentuje wzorzec w tych punktach.\nCo czyni linię „najlepszą”? Linia regresji minimalizuje całkowitą sumę kwadratów pionowych odległości od wszystkich punktów do linii. Pomyśl o tym jako o znalezieniu linii, która tworzy najmniejszy całkowity błąd predykcji.\nRównanie tej linii to: Y = a + bX + \\text{błąd}\nLub w naszym przykładzie: \\text{Dochód} = a + b \\times \\text{Wykształcenie} + \\text{błąd}\nGdzie:\n\na (wyraz wolny/intercept) = przewidywany dochód przy zerowym wykształceniu\nb (nachylenie/slope) = zmiana dochodu na każdy dodatkowy rok wykształcenia\nbłąd (e) = różnica między rzeczywistym a przewidywanym dochodem\n\nInterpretacja wyników:\nJeśli nasza analiza znajduje: \\text{Dochód} = 15000 + 4000 \\times \\text{Wykształcenie}\nTo mówi nam:\n\nKtoś z 0 latami wykształcenia przewidywany jest na zarobki 15 000 zł\nKażdy dodatkowy rok wykształcenia jest związany z 4000 zł większym dochodem\nKtoś z 12 latami wykształcenia przewidywany jest na zarobki: 15 000 + (4000 × 12) = 63 000 zł\nKtoś z 16 latami (licencjat) przewidywany jest na zarobki: 15 000 + (4000 × 16) = 79 000 zł\n\n\n\n\nZrozumienie relacji vs. dowodzenie przyczynowości\nKluczowe rozróżnienie: regresja pokazuje związek (association), niekoniecznie przyczynowość (causation). Nasza regresja wykształcenie-dochód pokazuje, że są powiązane, ale nie dowodzi, że wykształcenie powoduje wyższy dochód. Inne wyjaśnienia są możliwe:\n\nOdwrotna przyczynowość: Może bogatsze rodziny mogą sobie pozwolić na więcej edukacji dla swoich dzieci\nWspólna przyczyna: Być może inteligencja lub motywacja wpływa zarówno na wykształcenie, jak i dochód\nZbieg okoliczności: W małych próbach wzorce mogą pojawić się przez przypadek\n\nPrzykład pozornej korelacji: Regresja może pokazać, że sprzedaż lodów silnie przewiduje utopienia. Czy lody powodują utopienia? Nie! Oba wzrastają latem (wspólna przyczyna, confounding variable).\n\n\n\nRegresja wieloraka (Multiple Regression): Kontrolowanie innych czynników\nRzeczywistość jest skomplikowana — wiele czynników wpływa na wyniki jednocześnie. Regresja wieloraka pozwala nam badać jedną relację, jednocześnie „kontrolując” lub „utrzymując na stałym poziomie” inne zmienne.\n\nMoc kontroli statystycznej\nWracając do wykształcenia i dochodu, możemy się zastanawiać: Czy efekt wykształcenia wynika tylko z tego, że wykształceni ludzie są zwykle z bogatszych rodzin lub mieszkają w miastach? Regresja wieloraka może oddzielić te efekty:\n\\text{Dochód} = a + b_1 \\times \\text{Wykształcenie} + b_2 \\times \\text{Wiek} + b_3 \\times \\text{Miasto} + b_4 \\times \\text{Dochód rodziców} + \\text{błąd}\nTeraz b_1 reprezentuje efekt wykształcenia po uwzględnieniu wieku, lokalizacji i pochodzenia rodzinnego. Jeśli b_1 = 3000, oznacza to: „Porównując osoby w tym samym wieku, lokalizacji i pochodzeniu rodzinnym, każdy dodatkowy rok wykształcenia jest związany z 3000 zł większym dochodem.”\nPrzykład demograficzny: Płodność i wykształcenie kobiet\nBadacze badający płodność mogą znaleźć: \\text{Dzieci} = 4,5 - 0,3 \\times \\text{Wykształcenie}\nTo sugeruje, że każdy rok wykształcenia kobiet jest związany z 0,3 mniej dzieci. Ale czy wykształcenie jest przyczyną, czy wykształcone kobiety różnią się w innych aspektach? Dodając kontrole:\n\\text{Dzieci} = a - 0,15 \\times \\text{Wykształcenie} - 0,2 \\times \\text{Miasto} + 0,1 \\times \\text{Wykształcenie męża} - 0,4 \\times \\text{Dostęp do antykoncepcji}\nTeraz widzimy, że związek wykształcenia jest słabszy (-0,15 zamiast -0,3) po uwzględnieniu zamieszkania w mieście i dostępu do antykoncepcji. To sugeruje, że część pozornego efektu wykształcenia działa przez te inne ścieżki.\n\n\n\nTypy zmiennych w regresji\n\nZmienna wynikowa (zależna)\nTo jest to, co próbujemy zrozumieć lub przewidzieć:\n\nDochód w naszym pierwszym przykładzie\nLiczba dzieci w naszym przykładzie płodności\nOczekiwana długość życia w badaniach zdrowotnych\nPrawdopodobieństwo migracji w badaniach populacyjnych\n\n\n\nZmienne predykcyjne (niezależne)\nTo są czynniki, które według nas mogą wpływać na wynik:\n\nIlościowe: Wiek, lata wykształcenia, dochód, odległość\nJakościowe (kategorialne): Płeć, rasa, stan cywilny, region\nBinarne (dummy): Miasto/wieś, zatrudniony/bezrobotny, żonaty/nieżonaty\n\nObsługa zmiennych kategorialnych: Nie możemy bezpośrednio wstawić „religii” do równania. Zamiast tego tworzymy zmienne binarne:\n\nChrześcijanin = 1 jeśli chrześcijanin, 0 w przeciwnym razie\nMuzułmanin = 1 jeśli muzułmanin, 0 w przeciwnym razie\nBuddysta = 1 jeśli buddysta, 0 w przeciwnym razie\n(Jedna kategoria staje się grupą referencyjną)\n\n\n\n\nRóżne typy regresji dla różnych wyników\nPodstawowa idea regresji dostosowuje się do wielu sytuacji:\n\nRegresja liniowa\nDla wyników ilościowych (dochód, wzrost, ciśnienie krwi): Y = a + b_1X_1 + b_2X_2 + … + \\text{błąd}\n\n\nRegresja logistyczna\nDla wyników binarnych (zmarł/przeżył, wyemigrował/został, żonaty/nieżonaty):\nZamiast przewidywać wynik bezpośrednio, przewidujemy prawdopodobieństwo: \\log\\left(\\frac{p}{1-p}\\right) = a + b_1X_1 + b_2X_2 + …\nGdzie p to prawdopodobieństwo wystąpienia zdarzenia.\nPrzykład: Przewidywanie prawdopodobieństwa migracji na podstawie wieku, wykształcenia i stanu cywilnego. Model może stwierdzić, że młodzi, wykształceni, nieżonaci ludzie mają 40% prawdopodobieństwo migracji, podczas gdy starsi, mniej wykształceni, żonaci ludzie mają tylko 5% prawdopodobieństwo.\n\n\nRegresja Poissona\nDla wyników “zliczeniowych”/count data (liczba dzieci, liczba wizyt u lekarza): \\log(\\text{oczekiwana liczba}) = a + b_1X_1 + b_2X_2 + …\nPrzykład: Modelowanie liczby dzieci na podstawie charakterystyk kobiet. Przydatne, ponieważ zapewnia, że przewidywania nigdy nie są ujemne (nie można mieć -0,5 dziecka!).\n\n\nAnaliza przeżycia (model Coxa)/Regresja hazardu\nDo czego służy: Przewidywanie kiedy coś się stanie, nie tylko czy się stanie.\nProblem: Wyobraź sobie, że badasz jak długo trwają małżeństwa. Obserwujesz 1000 par przez 10 lat, ale na koniec badania: - 400 par się rozwiodło (wiesz dokładnie kiedy) - 600 par jest nadal w małżeństwie (nie wiesz czy/kiedy się rozwiodą)\nZwykła regresja nie radzi sobie z tym problemem “niekompletnej historii” — te 600 trwających małżeństw zawiera cenne informacje, ale nie znamy jeszcze ich zakończenia.\nJak pomagają modele Coxa: Zamiast próbować przewidzieć dokładny moment, skupiają się na ryzyku względnym — kto ma większą szansę na wcześniejsze doświadczenie zdarzenia. To jak pytanie “W dowolnym momencie, kto jest bardziej narażony?” zamiast “Dokładnie kiedy to się stanie?”\nZastosowania praktyczne: - Badania medyczne: Kto szybciej reaguje na leczenie? - Biznes: Którzy klienci wcześniej rezygnują z subskrypcji? - Nauki społeczne: Jakie czynniki powodują, że wydarzenia życiowe następują wcześniej/później?\n\n\n\n\nInterpretacja wyników regresji\n\nWspółczynniki\nWspółczynnik mówi nam o oczekiwanej zmianie wyniku przy wzroście predyktora o jedną jednostkę, przy zachowaniu stałości innych zmiennych.\nPrzykłady interpretacji:\nRegresja liniowa dla dochodu:\n\n„Każdy dodatkowy rok wykształcenia jest związany z 3500 zł wyższym rocznym dochodem, kontrolując wiek i doświadczenie”\n\nRegresja logistyczna dla śmiertelności niemowląt:\n\n„Każda dodatkowa wizyta prenatalna jest związana z 15% niższymi szansami śmierci niemowlęcia, kontrolując wiek i wykształcenie matki”\n\nRegresja wieloraka dla oczekiwanej długości życia:\n\n„Każde 1000 USD wzrostu PKB per capita jest związane z 0,4 roku dłuższą oczekiwaną długością życia, po kontroli wykształcenia i dostępu do opieki zdrowotnej”\n\n\n\nIstotność statystyczna\nRegresja testuje również, czy relacje mogą wynikać z przypadku:\n\nwartość p &lt; 0,05: Relacja nieprawdopodobna z powodu przypadku (statystycznie istotna)\nwartość p &gt; 0,05: Relacja może być prawdopodobnie losową zmiennością\n\n\nAle pamiętaj: Istotność statystyczna ≠ praktyczne znaczenie (“praktyczna istotność”). Przy dużych próbach malutkie efekty stają się „istotne”.\n\n\n\nPrzedziały ufności dla współczynników\nTak jak mamy przedziały ufności dla średnich lub propocji, mamy je dla współczynników regresji:\n„Efekt wykształcenia na dochód wynosi 3500 zł rocznie, 95% CI: [2800 zł, 4200 zł]”\nTo oznacza, że jesteśmy 95% pewni, że prawdziwy efekt mieści się między 2800 zł a 4200 zł.\n\n\nR-kwadrat: Jak dobrze model pasuje do danych?\nR^2 (R-kwadrat) mierzy proporcję zmienności wyniku wyjaśnioną przez predyktory:\n\nR^2 = 0: Predyktory nic nie wyjaśniają\nR^2 = 1: Predyktory wyjaśniają wszystko\nR^2 = 0,3: Predyktory wyjaśniają 30% zmienności\n\nPrzykład: Model dochodu z tylko wykształceniem może mieć R^2 = 0,15 (wykształcenie wyjaśnia 15% zmienności dochodu). Dodanie wieku, doświadczenia i lokalizacji może zwiększyć R^2 do 0,35 (razem wyjaśniają 35%).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nZałożenia i ograniczenia\n\n\n\nRegresja opiera się na założeniach, które mogą nie być spełnione:\n\nEgzogeniczność (brak ukrytych zależności)\nNajważniejsze założenie: predyktory nie mogą być skorelowane z błędami. Prościej mówiąc, nie powinny istnieć ukryte czynniki wpływające jednocześnie na zmienne objaśniające i wynik.\nPrzykład: Badając wpływ edukacji na dochód, ale pomijając “zdolności”, otrzymasz obciążone wyniki - zdolności wpływają zarówno na poziom wykształcenia, jak i dochód. To założenie zapisujemy jako: E[\\varepsilon | X] = 0\nDlaczego to kluczowe: Bez tego wszystkie twoje współczynniki są błędne, nawet przy milionach obserwacji!\n\n\nLiniowość\nZakłada związki prostoliniowe. A co jeśli wpływ edukacji na dochód jest silniejszy na wyższych poziomach? Możemy dodać człony wielomianowe: \\text{Dochód} = a + b_1 \\times \\text{Edukacja} + b_2 \\times \\text{Edukacja}^2\n\n\nNiezależność\nZakłada, że obserwacje są niezależne. Ale członkowie rodziny mogą być podobni, powtarzane pomiary tej samej osoby są powiązane, a sąsiedzi mogą na siebie wpływać. Specjalne metody radzą sobie z tymi zależnościami.\n\n\nHomoskedastyczność\nZakłada stałą wariancję błędów. Ale błędy predykcji mogą być większe dla osób o wysokich dochodach niż niskich. Wykresy diagnostyczne pomagają to wykryć.\n\n\nNormalność\nZakłada, że błędy mają rozkład normalny. Ważne dla małych prób i testów hipotez, mniej krytyczne dla dużych prób.\nUwaga: Pierwsze założenie (egzogeniczność) dotyczy otrzymania poprawnej odpowiedzi. Pozostałe dotyczą głównie precyzji i wnioskowania statystycznego. Naruszenie egzogeniczności oznacza, że model jest fundamentalnie błędny; naruszenie pozostałych oznacza, że przedziały ufności i p-wartości mogą być niedokładne.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCzęste pułapki statystyczne\n\n\n\n\nEndogeniczność (obciążenie pominiętą zmienną): Zapominanie o ukrytych czynnikach wpływających zarówno na X jak i Y, co narusza fundamentalne założenie egzogeniczności. Przykład: Badanie edukacja→dochód bez uwzględnienia zdolności.\nSymultaniczność/Odwrotna przyczynowość: Gdy X i Y określają się wzajemnie w tym samym czasie. Prosta regresja zakłada jednokierunkową przyczynowość, ale rzeczywistość często jest dwukierunkowa. Przykład: Cena wpływa na popyt ORAZ popyt wpływa na cenę jednocześnie.\nZmienne zakłócające (confounding): Nieuwzględnienie zmiennych wpływających zarówno na predyktor jak i wynik, co prowadzi do pozornych zależności. Przykład: Sprzedaż lodów koreluje z utonięciami (oba powodowane przez lato).\nBłąd selekcji: Nielosowe próby systematycznie wykluczające pewne grupy, uniemożliwiające generalizację. Przykład: Badanie użycia internetu tylko wśród posiadaczy smartfonów.\nBłąd ekologiczny: Zakładanie, że wzorce grupowe dotyczą jednostek. Przykład: Bogate kraje mają niższą dzietność ≠ bogaci ludzie mają mniej dzieci.\nP-hacking (drążenie danych): Testowanie wielu hipotez aż do znalezienia istotności, lub modyfikowanie analizy aż p &lt; 0,05. Przy 20 testach spodziewasz się 1 fałszywego wyniku przez przypadek!\nPrzeuczenie (overfitting): Budowanie modelu zbyt złożonego dla twoich danych - idealny na danych treningowych, bezużyteczny do predykcji. Pamiętaj: Z wystarczającą liczbą parametrów możesz dopasować słonia.\nBłąd przetrwania: Analizowanie tylko “ocalałych” ignorując porażki. Przykład: Badanie firm sukcesu pomijając te, które zbankrutowały.\nNadmierna generalizacja: Rozszerzanie wniosków poza badaną populację, okres czasu lub kontekst.

    "text": "2.16 Powszechne nieporozumienia w statystyce\nZrozumienie, czym statystyka NIE jest, jest równie ważne jak zrozumienie, czym jest.\n\nNieporozumienie 1: „Statystyki mogą udowodnić wszystko”\nRzeczywistość: Statystyki mogą dostarczyć tylko dowodów, nigdy absolutnego dowodu. A właściwa statystyka, uczciwie zastosowana, znacznie ogranicza wnioski.\nPrzykład: Badanie znajduje korelację między sprzedażą lodów a utopieniami. Statystyka nie „dowodzi”, że lody powodują utopienia — oba są związane z letnią pogodą.\n\n\nNieporozumienie 2: „Większe próby są zawsze lepsze”\nRzeczywistość: Poza pewnym punktem większe próby dodają niewiele precyzji, ale mogą dodać obciążenie.\nPrzykład: Ankieta online z 1 milionem odpowiedzi może być mniej dokładna niż próba probabilistyczna 1000 osób z powodu obciążenia samoselekcji.\nMalejące zyski:\n\nn = 100: Margines błędu \\approx 10%\nn = 1000: Margines błędu \\approx 3,2%\nn = 10 000: Margines błędu \\approx 1%\nn = 100 000: Margines błędu \\approx 0,32%\n\nSkok z 10 000 do 100 000 ledwo poprawia precyzję, ale kosztuje 10\\times więcej.\n\n\nNieporozumienie 3: “Istotność statystyczna = Praktyczne znaczenie”\nRzeczywistość: Przy dużych próbach malutkie różnice stają się „statystycznie istotne”, nawet jeśli są bez znaczenia.\nPrzykład: Badanie 100 000 osób stwierdza, że mężczyźni są średnio o 0,1 cm wyżsi (p &lt; 0,001). Statystycznie istotne, ale praktycznie nieistotne.\n\n\nNieporozumienie 4: “Korelacja implikuje przyczynowość”\nRzeczywistość: Korelacja jest konieczna, ale niewystarczająca dla przyczynowości.\nKlasyczne przykłady:\n\nMiasta z większą liczbą kościołów mają więcej przestępstw (oba korelują z wielkością populacji)\nKraje z większą liczbą telewizorów mają dłuższą oczekiwaną długość życia (oba korelują z rozwojem)\n\n\n\nNieporozumienie 5: “Losowy oznacza przypadkowy”\nRzeczywistość: Statystyczna losowość jest starannie kontrolowana i systematyczna.\nPrzykład: Losowe próbkowanie wymaga starannej procedury, a nie tylko chwytania kogokolwiek wygodnego.\n\n\nNieporozumienie 6: “Średnia reprezentuje wszystkich”\nRzeczywistość: Średnie mogą być mylące, gdy rozkłady są skośne lub wielomodalne.\nPrzykład: Średni dochód bywalców baru wynosi 50 000 zł. Bill Gates wchodzi. Teraz średnia wynosi 1 milion zł. Rzeczywisty dochód nikogo się nie zmienił.\n\n\nNieporozumienie 7: “Przeszłe wzorce gwarantują przyszłe wyniki”\nRzeczywistość: Ekstrapolacja zakłada, że warunki pozostają stałe.\nPrzykład: Liniowa projekcja wzrostu populacji z lat 1950-2000 źle przeszacowałaby populację 2050 roku, ponieważ pomija spadek płodności.",

    "text": "3.2 Discrete vs. Continuous Data\nIn data science and statistics, we often categorize variables as either discrete or continuous. However, the distinction is not always clear-cut, and some variables exhibit characteristics of both types. This section explores the concepts of discrete and continuous data, their differences, and the interesting cases of variables that can be treated as both or challenge our intuitive understanding.\n\n\n\nhttps://individual-psychometrics.rbind.io/\n\n\n\nDiscrete Data\nDiscrete data can only take on specific, countable values. These values are often (but not always) integers.\n\nCharacteristics of Discrete Data:\n\nCountable\nOften represented by integers\nCan be finite or infinite\nNo values between two adjacent data points\n\n\n\nExamples:\n\nNumber of students in a class\nNumber of cars sold by a dealership\nShoe sizes\n\n\n\n\nContinuous Data\nContinuous data can take on any value within a given range, including fractional and decimal values. It’s important to note that continuity is not solely determined by uncountability, but also by density.\n\nCharacteristics of Continuous Data:\n\nCan be uncountable (like real numbers) or dense (like rational numbers)\nCan be measured to any level of precision (theoretically)\nRepresented by real numbers or dense subsets of real numbers\nThere are always values between any two data points\n\n\n\nExamples:\n\nHeight\nWeight\nTemperature\nPercentages (explained further below)\n\n\n\n\nThe Discrete-Continuous Spectrum\nIn practice, some variables that are mathematically discrete are often treated as if they are continuous. This dual nature provides flexibility in how these variables can be analyzed and interpreted.\n\nReasons for Treating Discrete Data as Continuous:\n\nDense Granularity\n\nWhen a discrete variable has a large number of possible values within a range, it can approximate continuity.\nExample: Income measured in individual cents. While technically discrete, the large number of possible values makes it behave similarly to a continuous variable.\n\nAnalytical Convenience\n\nContinuous methods often yield reasonable and useful results even for dense discrete variables.\nIt’s often easier to use existing statistical tools if continuity is assumed, as this allows the use of calculus-based methods.\n\nApproximation of Underlying Phenomena\n\nIn some cases, a discrete measurement might be an approximation of an underlying continuous process.\nExample: While we measure time in discrete units (seconds, minutes, hours), time itself is continuous.\n\n\n\n\nExamples of Variables with Dual Discrete-Continuous Nature:\n\nAge\n\nDiscrete: Typically measured in whole years\nContinuous: Can be considered as a continuous variable in many analyses, especially when dealing with large populations\n\nPrice and Income\n\nDiscrete: Prices and incomes are actually measured in discrete units (e.g., cents or smallest currency unit)\nContinuous: In economic models and many analyses, prices and incomes are treated as continuous variables due to their dense nature and analytical convenience\n\nTest Scores\n\nDiscrete: Often given as whole numbers\nContinuous: In statistical analyses, test scores might be treated as continuous, especially when the range of possible scores is large\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecial Case: Percentages and Rational Numbers\nPercentages present an interesting case in the discrete-continuous spectrum:\n\nRational Nature: Percentages are essentially fractions (m/100), making them rational numbers.\nDense but Countable: The set of rational numbers is dense (between any two rationals, there’s another rational) but also countable.\nPractical Continuity: In most practical applications, percentages are treated as continuous due to their dense nature.\nFinite Precision: In reality, percentages are often reported to a limited number of decimal places, creating a finite set of possible values.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPercentages: Bridging Discrete and Continuous\n\n\n\nVariables measured in percentages, such as unemployment rates or voter turnout, challenge our intuitive understanding of discreteness and continuity:\n\nThey are rational numbers (fractions with denominator 100), which are technically countable.\nThey form a dense set within their range (0% to 100%), allowing for values between any two percentages.\nIn practice, they are often treated as continuous variables due to their dense nature and analytical convenience.\nThe precision of measurement (e.g., reporting to one or two decimal places) can impose a discrete structure on what is conceptually a dense set.\n\nThis duality allows for flexible analytical approaches, depending on the specific research context and required precision.\n\n\n\n\nImplications for Data Analysis\nUnderstanding the nuanced nature of variables as discrete, continuous, or somewhere in between has important implications for data analysis:\n\nFlexibility in Modeling: It allows for the use of a wider range of statistical techniques.\nSimplified Calculations: Treating dense discrete data as continuous can simplify calculations and make certain analyses more tractable.\nImproved Interpretability: In some cases, treating discrete data as continuous can lead to more intuitive or useful interpretations of results.\nPotential for Error: It’s important to be aware of when approximations are appropriate and when they might lead to misleading results.\nTheoretical vs. Practical Considerations: While the mathematical nature of the data is important, practical considerations in measurement and analysis often guide how we treat variables.\n\n\n\nConclusion\nThe distinction between discrete and continuous data is not always rigid in social sciences. Many variables, including those involving money, percentages, or dense measurements, can be viewed through both discrete and continuous lenses. The choice of treatment should be guided by the nature of the data, the goals of the analysis, and the potential implications of the choice. This flexibility, when used thoughtfully, provides powerful tools for social science researchers to gain insights from their data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscrete vs. Continuous Numerical Data: A Language-Based Analogies\n\n\n\n\nThe Language Connection\nThink about how you naturally ask questions about quantities:\n\n“How many cookies are in the jar?” (counting)\n“How much water is in the glass?” (measuring)\n\nThis natural language distinction reflects the two fundamental types of numerical data:\n\n\nDiscrete Data = “How Many?” Questions\n\nLike counting whole objects (countable nouns)\nTakes specific values with gaps between them\nExamples:\n\nNumber of pets: 0, 1, 2, 3… (can’t have 2.5 pets)\nDice rolls: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\nStudents in a class: 20, 21, 22…\n\n\n🤔 Self-Check: Can you find a value between 2 and 3 students?

    "section": "3.3 Introduction to Stevens’ Data Typology",
    "text": "3.3 Introduction to Stevens’ Data Typology\nStanley S. Stevens, an American psychologist, introduced a classification system for scales of measurement in his 1946 paper “On the Theory of Scales of Measurement.” This system, known as Stevens’ data typology or levels of measurement, has become fundamental in understanding how different types of data should be analyzed and interpreted.\nStevens proposed four levels of measurement:\n\nNominal\nOrdinal\nInterval\nRatio\n\nEach level has specific properties and allows for different types of statistical operations and analyses.\n\n\n\nhttps://individual-psychometrics.rbind.io/\n\n\n\n\nNominal Scale\n\nDefinition\nThe nominal scale is the most basic level of measurement. It uses labels or categories to classify data without any quantitative value or order.\n\n\nProperties\n\nCategories are mutually exclusive\nNo inherent order among categories\nNo meaningful arithmetic operations can be performed\n\n\n\nExamples\n\nNationality (Polish, English, …)\nBlood types (A, B, AB, O)\nEye color (Blue, Brown, Green, Hazel)\nBinary variables (“Success” versus “Failure”)\n\n\n\n\nOrdinal Scale\n\nDefinition\nThe ordinal scale categorizes data into ordered categories, but the intervals between categories are not necessarily equal or meaningful.\n\n\nProperties\n\nCategories have a defined order\nDifferences between categories are not quantifiable\nArithmetic operations on the numbers are not meaningful\n\n\n\nExamples\n\nEducation levels (High School, Bachelor’s, Master’s, PhD)\nLikert scales (Strongly Disagree, Disagree, Neutral, Agree, Strongly Agree)\nSocioeconomic status (Low, Medium, High)\n\n\n\n\nInterval Scale\n\nDefinition\nThe interval scale has ordered categories with equal intervals between adjacent categories. However, it lacks a true zero point.\n\n\nProperties\n\nEqual intervals between adjacent categories\nNo true zero point (zero is arbitrary)\nRatios between values are not meaningful\n\n\n\nExamples\n\nTemperature in Celsius or Fahrenheit\nCalendar years\npH scale (the difference between pH 4 and 5 represents the same change in hydrogen ion concentration as between pH 6 and 7)\nElevation above sea level\n\n\n\n\nRatio Scale\n\nDefinition\nThe ratio scale is the highest level of measurement. It has all the properties of the interval scale plus a true zero point, making ratios between values meaningful.\n\n\nProperties\n\nAll properties of interval scales\nTrue zero point\nRatios between values are meaningful\n\n\n\nExamples\n\nHeight\nWeight\nAge\nIncome\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy Some Statistics Work (and Others Don’t) for Interval Scales\n\n\n\n\nKey Idea\nAn interval scale is one where the distances between values are meaningful, but the zero point is arbitrary. For interval scales (e.g., temperature):\n\nAllowed: Addition/subtraction of values and multiplication/division by constants.\nNot allowed: Multiplication/division of values from the scale by each other, as this leads to results without physical interpretation.\n\n\n\nProperties of Interval Scales\n\nEqual intervals represent the same differences:\n\nThe difference between 20°C and 25°C (5°C) represents the same change as between 30°C and 35°C.\nProportions of differences are preserved: 10°C is twice the change of 5°C.\n\nThe zero point is arbitrary:\n\n0°C is the freezing point of water, not the absence of temperature.\nThe same physical state has different values in different scales: 0°C = 32°F.\n\nLinear transformation:\n\nGeneral formula: y = ax + b, where a \\neq 0.\nFor temperature: F = C \\times \\frac{9}{5} + 32.\n\n\n\n\nTheoretical Conclusions\n\nAllowed operations:\n\nAddition/subtraction (preserves differences).\nMultiplication/division by constants (scaling).\nArithmetic means.\nComparing temperature differences.\n\nNot allowed operations:\n\nMultiplying temperatures by each other.\nDividing temperatures by each other.\nGeometric means.\nCoefficient of variation.\n\nPractical implications:\n\nVariance and standard deviation require careful interpretation.\nBetter to use measures based on differences (e.g., MAD - mean absolute deviation).\nWhen comparing variability, it is advisable to standardize the data.\n\n\n\n\nPractical Rule\nIf your calculations involve multiplying values from an interval scale by each other, be particularly cautious in interpreting the results!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportance in Research and Analysis\nUnderstanding Stevens’ data typology is crucial for several reasons:\n\nChoosing appropriate statistical tests: The level of measurement determines which statistical analyses are appropriate for a given dataset.\nInterpreting results: The meaning of statistical results depends on the level of measurement of the variables involved.\nDesigning measurement instruments: When creating surveys or other measurement tools, researchers must consider the level of measurement they want to achieve.\nData transformation: Sometimes, data can be transformed from one level to another, but this must be done carefully to avoid misinterpretation.\n\n\n\nControversies and Limitations\nWhile Stevens’ typology is widely used, it has faced some criticisms:\n\nRigidity: Some argue that the typology is too rigid and that many real-world measurements fall between these categories.\nTreatment of ordinal data: There’s ongoing debate about when it’s appropriate to treat ordinal data as interval for certain analyses.\nPsychological scaling: Some psychological constructs (like intelligence) are difficult to categorize definitively within this system.\n\n\n\nConclusion\nStevens’ data typology provides a fundamental framework for understanding different types of data and their properties. By recognizing the level of measurement of their variables, researchers can make informed decisions about data collection, analysis, and interpretation. However, it’s important to remember that while this typology is a useful guide, real-world data often requires nuanced consideration and may not always fit neatly into these categories.\n\n\n\n\n\n\npH as an Interval Scale\n\n\n\npH is considered an interval scale because:\n\nIt has ordered categories: Lower pH values indicate higher acidity, while higher values indicate higher alkalinity.\nThe intervals between adjacent pH values are equal in terms of hydrogen ion concentration:\n\nEach whole number change in pH represents a tenfold change in hydrogen ion concentration.\nFor example, the difference in acidity between pH 4 and pH 5 is the same as the difference between pH 7 and pH 8.\n\nIt lacks a true zero point:\n\npH 0 does not represent a complete absence of hydrogen ions.\nNegative pH values and values above 14 are possible in extreme conditions.\n\nRatios are not meaningful:\n\nA pH of 4 is not “twice as acidic” as a pH of 2.\nThe ratio of hydrogen ion concentrations, not pH values, indicates relative acidity.\n\n\nThese characteristics align with the definition of an interval scale, where the differences between values are meaningful and consistent, but ratios are not interpretable.\n\n\n\n\nReality: IQ is Fundamentally an Ordinal Scale\nHow IQ scores are created – step by step:\n\nCollecting raw scores: People take a test and receive a number of correct answers (e.g., 45 out of 60 questions)\nOrdering: All raw scores are arranged from worst to best\nAssigning ranks: Each score is assigned a position in the ranking\nTransformation to IQ scale: Ranks are mathematically transformed so that the mean equals 100 and standard deviation equals 15\n\nKey problem: This process forces a normal distribution onto data that may not have been normal in its original form. This means that equal differences in IQ points (e.g., difference between IQ 100 and 115 vs. difference between IQ 115 and 130) may not correspond to equal differences in actual cognitive abilities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Point\n\n\n\nIQ 130 does not mean “twice the intelligence” of IQ 65. IQ points only show a person’s position relative to other people in the sample, not the actual amount of intelligence. This is similar to places in a competition – the winner might win by a hair or by miles, but will still be in first place.\n\n\nIn research practice: why do we sometimes treat IQ as an interval scale?\nThis is a methodological compromise that allows for the use of more precise statistical tools:\n✅ Treating IQ as an interval scale is acceptable when: - Using standard statistical tests (correlations, regressions, t-tests) - Comparing groups within the same test and population - Being aware of the limitations of this approach - Our conclusions don’t depend on differences being exactly equal\n⚠️ Remember the limitations: - This is a simplification of reality - The assumption works better for scores near the mean (IQ 85-115) than at the extremes - Results must be interpreted carefully\n❌ Never: - Say that IQ differences mean equal differences in intelligence - Use statements like “twice as intelligent” - Forget that the normal distribution was imposed, not discovered in the data\n\n\nPractical Guidelines for Researchers\n\nBe transparent:\n\nClearly state: “We treat IQ as an interval scale for statistical purposes, remembering that it is fundamentally an ordinal scale”\n\nConsider alternatives:\n\nUse non-parametric tests when sample size allows\nCompare results from different analytical methods\n\nInterpret cautiously:\n\nFocus on statements about order (“group A achieved higher scores than group B”)\nAvoid precise statements about the magnitude of differences\nRemember: a 15-point IQ difference means “one standard deviation in the sample,” not “a specific amount of additional intelligence”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIQ is an ordinal scale that has been transformed to look like an interval scale. It can be used in statistical analyses requiring an interval scale, but one must always remember its true nature when interpreting results. The key is understanding that IQ points tell us about position in a group, not about the absolute amount of intelligence.",

    "text": "3.4 Common Ordinal Scales in Behavioural Research\n\nLikert Scales\nLikert scales are widely used in psychology and social sciences to measure attitudes, opinions, and perceptions. Named after psychologist Rensis Likert, these scales typically consist of a series of statements or questions that respondents rate on a scale, often from “Strongly Disagree” to “Strongly Agree.”\n\n\n\nhttps://individual-psychometrics.rbind.io/\n\n\n\nWhy Likert Scales are Ordinal Variables\nLikert scales are considered ordinal variables for several reasons:\n\nOrder without equal intervals: While the responses have a clear order (e.g., “Strongly Disagree” &lt; “Disagree” &lt; “Neutral” &lt; “Agree” &lt; “Strongly Agree”), the intervals between these categories are not necessarily equal.\nSubjective interpretation: The difference between “Strongly Disagree” and “Disagree” may not be the same as the difference between “Agree” and “Strongly Agree” for all respondents.\nLack of true zero point: Likert scales typically don’t have a true zero point, which is a characteristic of interval or ratio scales.\n\n\n\n\nIQ and Other Psychological Variables as Ordinal Measures\nMany psychological measures, including IQ, are often treated as interval scales but are, in fact, ordinal. Here’s why:\n\nIQ Scores:\n\nWhile IQ scores are presented as numbers, the difference between an IQ of 100 and 110 may not represent the same cognitive difference as between 130 and 140.\nThe scale is normalized and adjusted over time, making it difficult to claim true interval properties.\n\nOther Psychological Measures:\n\nDepression scales (e.g., Beck Depression Inventory)\nAnxiety measures (e.g., State-Trait Anxiety Inventory)\nPersonality assessments (e.g., Big Five Inventory)\n\n\nThese measures often use summed Likert-type items or other scoring methods that don’t guarantee equal intervals between scores.\n\n\nImplications for Analysis\nRecognizing these measures as ordinal has important implications for data analysis:\n\nAppropriate statistical tests: Use non-parametric tests (e.g., Mann-Whitney U, Kruskal-Wallis) instead of parametric ones.\nCorrelation analysis: Use Spearman’s rank correlation instead of Pearson’s correlation.\nCentral tendency: Report median and mode rather than mean.\nData visualization: Use methods appropriate for ordinal data, such as bar plots or stacked bar charts.\n\n\n\nConclusion\nWhile Likert scales and many behavioural measures are often treated as interval data for practical reasons, it’s crucial to remember their ordinal nature.\n\n\n\nhttps://individual-psychometrics.rbind.io/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise: Identifying Measurement Scales\n\n\n\nFor each of the following variables, determine the most appropriate scale of measurement (Nominal, Ordinal, Interval, or Ratio). Also evaluate whether the variable is discrete or continuous.\n\nGender: nominal level of measurement, and discrete;\nCustomer satisfaction: Poor, Fair, Good, Excellent\nHeight (questionnaire): “I am: very short, short, average, tall, very tall”\nHeight (inches)\nReaction time (milliseconds)\nPostal codes: e.g., 61548, 61761, 62461, 47424, 65233\nAge (years)\nNationality\nStreet addresses\nMilitary ranks\nLeft-Right political scale placement\nFamily size: 1 child, 2 children, 3 children, …\nIQ score\nShirt size (S, M, L, …)\nMovie ratings (1 star, 2 stars, 3 stars)\nTemperature (Celsius)\nTemperature (Kelvin)\nBlood types: A, B, AB, O\nIncome categories: low, medium, high\nVoter turnout\nPolitical party affiliation\nElectoral district magnitude\n\nRemember to justify your choices for each variable.\nFor instance: In Stevens’ typology of measurement scales, street addresses are nominal data. This is because:\nThey serve purely as labels/identifiers. They have no inherent ordering (123 Main St isn’t “more than” 23 Oak St). You can’t perform meaningful mathematical operations on them.The only valid operation is testing for equality/inequality (is this the same address or different?)",

    "text": "4.2 Dane Dyskretne vs. Ciągłe\nW nauce o danych i statystyce często kategoryzujemy zmienne jako dyskretne lub ciągłe. Jednak rozróżnienie to nie zawsze jest jednoznaczne, a niektóre zmienne wykazują cechy obu typów. Ta sekcja bada koncepcje danych dyskretnych i ciągłych, ich różnice oraz interesujące przypadki zmiennych, które można traktować jako oba typy lub które kwestionują nasze intuicyjne rozumienie.\n\n\n\nhttps://individual-psychometrics.rbind.io/\n\n\n\nDane Dyskretne\nDane dyskretne mogą przyjmować tylko określone, przeliczalne wartości. Te wartości często (ale nie zawsze) są liczbami całkowitymi.\n\nCechy Danych Dyskretnych:\n\nPrzeliczalne\nCzęsto reprezentowane przez liczby całkowite\nMogą być skończone lub nieskończone\nBrak wartości między dwoma sąsiednimi punktami danych\n\n\n\nPrzykłady:\n\nLiczba studentów w klasie\nLiczba samochodów sprzedanych przez dealera\nRozmiary butów\n\n\n\n\nDane Ciągłe\nDane ciągłe mogą przyjmować dowolną wartość w danym zakresie, w tym wartości ułamkowe i dziesiętne. Ważne jest, aby zauważyć, że ciągłość nie jest określona wyłącznie przez nieprzeliczalność, ale również przez gęstość.\n\nCechy Danych Ciągłych:\n\nMogą być nieprzeliczalne (jak liczby rzeczywiste) lub gęste (jak liczby wymierne)\nMogą być mierzone z dowolną precyzją (teoretycznie)\nReprezentowane przez liczby rzeczywiste lub gęste podzbiory liczb rzeczywistych\nZawsze istnieją wartości między dowolnymi dwoma punktami danych\n\n\n\nPrzykłady:\n\nWzrost\nWaga\nTemperatura\nProcenty (wyjaśnione dalej poniżej)\n\n\n\n\nSpektrum Dyskretno-Ciągłe\nW praktyce niektóre zmienne, które matematycznie są dyskretne, często są traktowane tak, jakby były ciągłe. Ta dwoista natura zapewnia elastyczność w analizie i interpretacji tych zmiennych.\n\nPowody Traktowania Danych Dyskretnych jako Ciągłych:\n\nGęsta Granularność\n\nGdy zmienna dyskretna ma dużą liczbę możliwych wartości w danym zakresie, może przybliżać ciągłość.\nPrzykład: Dochód mierzony w pojedynczych groszach. Choć technicznie dyskretny, duża liczba możliwych wartości sprawia, że zachowuje się podobnie do zmiennej ciągłej.\n\nWygoda Analityczna\n\nMetody ciągłe często dają rozsądne i użyteczne wyniki nawet dla gęstych zmiennych dyskretnych.\nCzęsto łatwiej jest używać istniejących narzędzi statystycznych, jeśli założymy ciągłość, ponieważ pozwala to na stosowanie metod opartych na rachunku różniczkowym.\n\nPrzybliżenie Zjawisk Bazowych\n\nW niektórych przypadkach dyskretny pomiar może być przybliżeniem bazowego procesu ciągłego.\nPrzykład: Chociaż mierzymy czas w dyskretnych jednostkach (sekundy, minuty, godziny), sam czas jest ciągły.\n\n\n\n\nPrzykłady Zmiennych o Dwoistej Naturze Dyskretno-Ciągłej:\n\nWiek\n\nDyskretny: Typowo mierzony w pełnych latach\nCiągły: Może być uznany za zmienną ciągłą w wielu analizach, szczególnie przy dużych populacjach\n\nCena i Dochód\n\nDyskretne: Ceny i dochody są w rzeczywistości mierzone w dyskretnych jednostkach (np. grosze lub najmniejsza jednostka waluty)\nCiągłe: W modelach ekonomicznych i wielu analizach ceny i dochody są traktowane jako zmienne ciągłe ze względu na ich gęstą naturę i wygodę analityczną\n\nWyniki Testów\n\nDyskretne: Często podawane jako liczby całkowite\nCiągłe: W analizach statystycznych wyniki testów mogą być traktowane jako ciągłe, szczególnie gdy zakres możliwych wyników jest duży\n\n\n\n\n\nPrzypadek Szczególny: Procenty i Liczby Wymierne\nProcenty przedstawiają interesujący przypadek w spektrum dyskretno-ciągłym:\n\nNatura Wymierna: Procenty są zasadniczo ułamkami (m/100), co czyni je liczbami wymiernymi.\nGęste, ale Przeliczalne: Zbiór liczb wymiernych jest gęsty (między dowolnymi dwoma wymiernymi jest inny wymierny), ale także przeliczalny.\nPraktyczna Ciągłość: W większości praktycznych zastosowań procenty są traktowane jako ciągłe ze względu na ich gęstą naturę.\nSkończona Precyzja: W rzeczywistości procenty są często podawane z ograniczoną liczbą miejsc po przecinku, tworząc skończony zbiór możliwych wartości.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProcenty: Łączenie Dyskretnego i Ciągłego\n\n\n\nZmienne mierzone w procentach, takie jak stopy bezrobocia czy frekwencja wyborcza, kwestionują nasze intuicyjne rozumienie dyskretności i ciągłości:\n\nSą liczbami wymiernymi (ułamki z mianownikiem 100), które technicznie są przeliczalne.\nTworzą zbiór gęsty w swoim zakresie (od 0% do 100%), pozwalając na wartości między dowolnymi dwoma procentami.\nW praktyce są często traktowane jako zmienne ciągłe ze względu na ich gęstą naturę i wygodę analityczną.\nPrecyzja pomiaru (np. podawanie do jednego lub dwóch miejsc po przecinku) może narzucić dyskretną strukturę na to, co koncepcyjnie jest zbiorem gęstym.\n\nTa dwoistość pozwala na elastyczne podejścia analityczne, w zależności od konkretnego kontekstu badawczego i wymaganej precyzji.\n\n\n\n\nImplikacje dla Analizy Danych\nZrozumienie zniuansowanej natury zmiennych jako dyskretnych, ciągłych lub gdzieś pomiędzy ma ważne implikacje dla analizy danych:\n\nElastyczność w Modelowaniu: Pozwala na wykorzystanie szerszego zakresu technik statystycznych.\nUproszczone Obliczenia: Traktowanie gęstych danych dyskretnych jako ciągłych może uprościć obliczenia i uczynić niektóre analizy bardziej wykonalnymi.\nLepsza Interpretowalność: W niektórych przypadkach traktowanie danych dyskretnych jako ciągłych może prowadzić do bardziej intuicyjnych lub użytecznych interpretacji wyników.\nPotencjał Błędu: Ważne jest, aby być świadomym, kiedy przybliżenia są odpowiednie, a kiedy mogą prowadzić do mylących wyników.\nRozważania Teoretyczne vs. Praktyczne: Choć matematyczna natura danych jest ważna, praktyczne względy w pomiarze i analizie często kierują tym, jak traktujemy zmienne.\n\n\n\nWnioski\nRozróżnienie między danymi dyskretnymi a ciągłymi nie zawsze jest sztywne w naukach społecznych. Wiele zmiennych, w tym te dotyczące pieniędzy, procentów czy gęstych pomiarów, można oglądać przez pryzmat zarówno dyskretny, jak i ciągły. Wybór sposobu traktowania powinien być kierowany naturą danych, celami analizy i potencjalnymi implikacjami tego wyboru. Ta elastyczność, gdy jest używana rozważnie, zapewnia potężne narzędzia dla badaczy nauk społecznych do uzyskiwania wglądu w ich dane.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDane Dyskretne vs. Ciągłe: Analogia Językowa\n\n\n\n\nKluczowe Rozróżnienie Językowe\nW języku polskim mamy precyzyjne rozróżnienie:\n\n“Liczba” → używamy dla rzeczy policzalnych\n“Ilość” → używamy dla rzeczy niepoliczalnych\n\nTo rozróżnienie doskonale odzwierciedla dwa podstawowe typy danych liczbowych:\n\n\nDane Dyskretne = “Liczba czegoś”\n\nUżywamy słowa “liczba” (tak jak mówimy “liczba studentów”)\nWartości są rozdzielone jak pojedyncze elementy\nPrzykłady:\n\nLiczba książek: 0, 1, 2, 3…\nLiczba punktów w teście: 0, 1, 2…\nLiczba mieszkańców: 100, 101, 102…\n\n\n🤔 Czy poprawne jest powiedzenie “ilość studentów” czy “liczba studentów”?

    "text": "4.3 Wprowadzenie do Typologii Danych Stevensa\nStanley S. Stevens, amerykański psycholog, wprowadził system klasyfikacji skal pomiarowych w swoim artykule z 1946 roku “On the Theory of Scales of Measurement”. Ten system, znany jako typologia danych Stevensa lub poziomy pomiaru, stał się fundamentalny dla zrozumienia, jak różne typy danych powinny być analizowane i interpretowane.\nStevens zaproponował cztery poziomy pomiaru:\n\nNominalny\nPorządkowy\nInterwałowy\nIlorazowy\n\nKażdy poziom ma specyficzne właściwości i pozwala na różne rodzaje operacji statystycznych i analiz.\n\n\n\nhttps://individual-psychometrics.rbind.io/\n\n\n\n\nSkala Nominalna\n\nDefinicja\nSkala nominalna jest najbardziej podstawowym poziomem pomiaru. Używa etykiet lub kategorii do klasyfikacji danych bez żadnej wartości ilościowej ani porządku.\n\n\nWłaściwości\n\nKategorie są wzajemnie wykluczające się\nBrak inherentnego porządku między kategoriami\nNie można wykonywać znaczących operacji arytmetycznych\n\n\n\nPrzykłady\n\nNarodowość (Polak, Niemiec, …)\nGrupy krwi (A, B, AB, O)\nKolor oczu (Niebieskie, Brązowe, Zielone, Piwne)\nZmienne binarne (“Sukces” versus “Niepowodzenie”)\n\n\n\n\nSkala Porządkowa\n\nDefinicja\nSkala porządkowa kategoryzuje dane w uporządkowane kategorie, ale odstępy między kategoriami niekoniecznie są równe lub znaczące.\n\n\nWłaściwości\n\nKategorie mają zdefiniowany porządek\nRóżnice między kategoriami nie są kwantyfikowalne\nOperacje arytmetyczne na liczbach nie są znaczące\n\n\n\nPrzykłady\n\nPoziomy wykształcenia (Szkoła Średnia, Licencjat, Magister, Doktorat)\nSkale Likerta (Zdecydowanie się nie zgadzam, Nie zgadzam się, Neutralnie, Zgadzam się, Zdecydowanie się zgadzam)\nStatus społeczno-ekonomiczny (Niski, Średni, Wysoki)\n\n\n\n\nSkala Interwałowa\n\nDefinicja\nSkala interwałowa ma uporządkowane kategorie z równymi odstępami między sąsiednimi kategoriami. Jednak brakuje jej prawdziwego punktu zerowego.\n\n\nWłaściwości\n\nRówne odstępy między sąsiednimi kategoriami\nBrak prawdziwego punktu zerowego (zero jest umowne)\nStosunki między wartościami nie są znaczące\n\n\n\nPrzykłady\n\nTemperatura w stopniach Celsjusza lub Fahrenheita\nLata kalendarzowe\nSkala pH\nWysokość nad poziomem morza\n\n\n\n\nSkala Ilorazowa\n\nDefinicja\nSkala ilorazowa jest najwyższym poziomem pomiaru. Ma wszystkie właściwości skali interwałowej plus prawdziwy punkt zerowy, co sprawia, że stosunki między wartościami są znaczące.\n\n\nWłaściwości\n\nWszystkie właściwości skal interwałowych\nPrawdziwy punkt zerowy\nStosunki między wartościami są znaczące\n\n\n\nPrzykłady\n\nWzrost\nWaga\nWiek\nDochód\n\n\n\n\nZnaczenie w Badaniach i Analizie\nZrozumienie typologii danych Stevensa jest kluczowe z kilku powodów:\n\nWybór odpowiednich testów statystycznych: Poziom pomiaru determinuje, które analizy statystyczne są odpowiednie dla danego zbioru danych.\nInterpretacja wyników: Znaczenie wyników statystycznych zależy od poziomu pomiaru zaangażowanych zmiennych.\nProjektowanie narzędzi pomiarowych: Przy tworzeniu ankiet lub innych narzędzi pomiarowych badacze muszą wziąć pod uwagę poziom pomiaru, który chcą osiągnąć.\nTransformacja danych: Czasami dane mogą być przekształcane z jednego poziomu na drugi, ale musi to być robione ostrożnie, aby uniknąć błędnej interpretacji.\n\n\n\nKontrowersje i Ograniczenia\nChociaż typologia Stevensa jest szeroko stosowana, spotkała się z pewnymi krytykami:\n\nSztywność: Niektórzy twierdzą, że typologia jest zbyt sztywna i że wiele rzeczywistych pomiarów mieści się pomiędzy tymi kategoriami.\nTraktowanie danych porządkowych: Trwa debata na temat tego, kiedy właściwe jest traktowanie danych porządkowych jako interwałowych dla pewnych analiz.\nSkalowanie psychologiczne: Niektóre konstrukty psychologiczne (jak inteligencja) są trudne do jednoznacznego skategoryzowania w ramach tego systemu.\n\n\n\nPodsumowanie\nTypologia danych Stevensa dostarcza fundamentalnych ram dla zrozumienia różnych rodzajów danych i ich właściwości. Rozpoznając poziom pomiaru swoich zmiennych, badacze mogą podejmować świadome decyzje dotyczące gromadzenia danych, analizy i interpretacji. Jednak ważne jest, aby pamiętać, że chociaż ta typologia jest użytecznym przewodnikiem, rzeczywiste dane często wymagają niuansowego podejścia i nie zawsze pasują idealnie do tych kategorii.\n\n\n\n\n\n\npH as an Interval Scale\n\n\n\npH is considered an interval scale because:\n\nIt has ordered categories: Lower pH values indicate higher acidity, while higher values indicate higher alkalinity.\nThe intervals between adjacent pH values are equal in terms of hydrogen ion concentration:\n\nEach whole number change in pH represents a tenfold change in hydrogen ion concentration.\nFor example, the difference in acidity between pH 4 and pH 5 is the same as the difference between pH 7 and pH 8.\n\nIt lacks a true zero point:\n\npH 0 does not represent a complete absence of hydrogen ions.\nNegative pH values and values above 14 are possible in extreme conditions.\n\nRatios are not meaningful:\n\nA pH of 4 is not “twice as acidic” as a pH of 2.\nThe ratio of hydrogen ion concentrations, not pH values, indicates relative acidity.\n\n\nThese characteristics align with the definition of an interval scale, where the differences between values are meaningful and consistent, but ratios are not interpretable.",

    "text": "4.5 Skale pomiarowe według typologii Stevensa: zmienne ilościowe vs. porządkowe\n\nCzym są zmienne ilościowe (numeryczne)?\nW typologii Stevensa wyróżniamy cztery skale pomiarowe. Zmienne ilościowe to te, które mierzone są na skalach interwałowych lub ilorazowych:\n\nSkala interwałowa: Posiada równe odstępy między jednostkami, ale brak naturalnego punktu zerowego\nSkala ilorazowa: Posiada równe odstępy między jednostkami oraz naturalny punkt zerowy\n\nZmienne ilościowe charakteryzują się następującymi właściwościami:\n\nRówne interwały: Różnica między 5 a 6 reprezentuje taką samą wielkość jak różnica między 95 a 96\nSpójne jednostki: Każdy przyrost reprezentuje taką samą ilość mierzonej cechy\nObiektywny pomiar: Mierzą rzeczywiste ilości, a nie tylko względne pozycje\nDopuszczalne operacje matematyczne: Można wykonywać operacje arytmetyczne\n\nPrzykłady zmiennych mierzonych na skali ilorazowej:\n\nWzrost: 170 cm jest dokładnie o 10 cm wyższe niż 160 cm, a 170 cm jest dokładnie dwa razy wyższe niż 85 cm\nWaga: Różnica między 50 kg a 60 kg to taka sama ilość wagi jak między 80 kg a 90 kg\nCzas: 4 godziny to dwa razy dłużej niż 2 godziny, a różnica między 3 a 4 godzinami jest taka sama jak między 9 a 10 godzinami\nTemperatura w Kelwinach: 200K jest dwa razy cieplejsza niż 100K (ponieważ 0K to zero absolutne)\n\nPrzykład skali interwałowej:\n\nTemperatura w stopniach Celsjusza: Różnica między 20°C a 30°C jest taka sama jak między 70°C a 80°C, ale 40°C nie jest “dwa razy cieplejsze” niż 20°C (brak naturalnego zera)\nRok kalendarzowy: Różnica między 2020 a 2021 jest taka sama jak między 1950 a 1951, ale rok 2000 nie jest “dwa razy starszy” niż rok 1000\n\n\n\nRzeczywistość: IQ to fundamentalnie skala porządkowa\nJak powstają wyniki IQ – krok po kroku:\n\nZbieranie surowych wyników: Ludzie rozwiązują test i otrzymują liczbę poprawnych odpowiedzi (np. 45 z 60 pytań)\nUporządkowanie: Wszystkie surowe wyniki są uszeregowane od najgorszego do najlepszego\nPrzypisanie rang: Każdemu wynikowi przypisuje się pozycję w rankingu\nPrzekształcenie na skalę IQ: Rangi są przekształcane matematycznie tak, aby średnia wynosiła 100, a odchylenie standardowe 15\n\nKluczowy problem: Proces ten wymusza rozkład normalny na dane, które może wcale nie były normalne w pierwotnej postaci. To znaczy, że równe różnice w punktach IQ (np. różnica między IQ 100 a 115 vs. różnica między IQ 115 a 130) nie muszą odpowiadać równym różnicom w rzeczywistych zdolnościach poznawczych.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nIQ 130 nie oznacza „dwukrotnie większej inteligencji” niż IQ 65. Punkty IQ pokazują tylko pozycję danej osoby względem innych ludzi w próbie, nie rzeczywistą ilość inteligencji. To podobnie jak miejsca w konkursie – zwycięzca może wygrać o włos lub o kilometry, ale nadal będzie pierwszym miejscem.\n\n\nW praktyce badawczej: dlaczego czasem traktujemy IQ jako skalę interwałową?\nJest to metodologiczny kompromis, który pozwala na użycie bardziej precyzyjnych narzędzi statystycznych:\n✅ Traktowanie IQ jako skali interwałowej jest dopuszczalne gdy: - Używamy standardowych testów statystycznych (korelacje, regresje, testy t) - Porównujemy grupy w ramach tego samego testu i populacji - Jesteśmy świadomi ograniczeń tego podejścia - Nasze wnioski nie zależą od tego, czy różnice są dokładnie równe\n⚠️ Pamiętaj o ograniczeniach: - To uproszczenie rzeczywistości - Założenie działa lepiej dla wyników bliskich średniej (IQ 85-115) niż na krańcach - Wyniki trzeba interpretować ostrożnie\n❌ Nigdy nie wolno: - Mówić, że różnice IQ oznaczają równe różnice w inteligencji - Używać stwierdzeń typu “dwa razy bardziej inteligentny” - Zapomnieć, że normalny rozkład został wymuszony, a nie odkryty w danych\n\n\nPraktyczne wskazówki dla badaczy\n\nBądź transparentny:\n\nWyraźnie wspominaj: “Traktujemy IQ jako skalę interwałową do celów statystycznych, pamiętając że fundamentalnie jest to skala porządkowa”\n\nRozważaj alternatywy:\n\nUżywaj testów nieparametrycznych, gdy wielkość próby na to pozwala\nPorównaj wyniki różnych metod analitycznych\n\nInterpretuj ostrożnie:\n\nSkupiaj się na stwierdzeniach o kolejności („grupa A osiągnęła wyższe wyniki niż grupa B”)\nUnikaj precyzyjnych stwierdzeń o wielkości różnic\nPamiętaj: różnica 15 punktów IQ oznacza „jedno odchylenie standardowe w próbie”, nie „konkretną ilość dodatkowej inteligencji”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIQ to skala porządkowa, która została przekształcona tak, aby wyglądała jak skala interwałowa. Można używać jej w analizach statystycznych wymagających skali interwałowej, ale zawsze należy pamiętać o jej rzeczywistej naturze przy interpretacji wyników. Kluczowe jest zrozumienie, że punkty IQ mówią nam o pozycji w grupie, nie o bezwzględnej ilości inteligencji.\n\n\nMimo liczbowego zapisu, wyniki IQ są w istocie zmienną porządkową (w typologii Stevensa), a nie zmienną interwałową, ponieważ:\n\nBrak jednolitej jednostki miary: Nie istnieje naturalna jednostka mierząca “inteligencję”\nKonstrukcja oparta na rangach: Skala powstaje przez uszeregowanie ludzi względem siebie, a następnie przekształcenie tych rang w wyniki liczbowe\nNierówne interwały: Różnica między IQ 100 a 110 niekoniecznie reprezentuje taką samą różnicę poznawczą jak między 130 a 140\nBrak absolutnego zera: Nie istnieje znaczące pojęcie “zerowej inteligencji”\nZależność od testu: Różne testy IQ mogą dać różne wyniki dla tej samej osoby\n\nPrzykład: Rozważmy trzy osoby z wynikami IQ 85, 100 i 115. Choć moglibyśmy chcieć powiedzieć, że różnica między pierwszą a drugą osobą równa się różnicy między drugą a trzecią, nie jest to faktycznie znaczące—zdolności poznawcze reprezentowane przez te wyniki nie wzrastają w równych krokach, mimo że cyfry sugerują równe odstępy. Wyniki te informują nas głównie o pozycji osoby względem innych, co jest cechą skali porządkowej.\nInny przykład: Osoba z IQ 140 nie jest “dwa razy inteligentniejsza” niż osoba z IQ 70, mimo że stosunek liczb wynosi 2:1. Takie porównanie nie ma sensu na skali porządkowej.\n\n\nPunkty egzaminacyjne - pomiędzy skalą porządkową a interwałową\nChoć traktujemy punkty egzaminacyjne jak zmienne ilościowe (interwałowe), często mają one cechy zmiennych porządkowych:\n\nNierówna trudność pytań: Pytanie za 10 punktów z fizyki kwantowej nie mierzy tej samej ilości wiedzy co pytanie za 10 punktów z podstawowej arytmetyki\nRóżne rodzaje kompetencji: Różne pytania testują różne umiejętności (zapamiętywanie, rozumienie, zastosowanie, analiza)\nSubiektywne przydzielanie punktów: Punktacja zależy od oceny egzaminatora, a nie obiektywnych jednostek miary\nBrak addytywności: Student zdobywający 90 punktów niekoniecznie jest “dwa razy bardziej wykształcony” niż student zdobywający 45 punktów\n\nPrzykład: Wyobraźmy sobie dwóch studentów:\n\nStudent A: Odpowiada prawidłowo na wszystkie łatwe i średnie pytania (zdobywa 75 punktów)\nStudent B: Odpowiada prawidłowo na wszystkie trudne pytania, ale żadne łatwe (zdobywa 75 punktów)\n\nMimo równej punktacji, ich wiedza jest jakościowo różna. Punkty sugerują równość, ale w rzeczywistości są to różne profile kompetencji — typowy problem ze zmiennymi, które nie są w pełni ilościowe.\n\n\nTraktowanie zmiennych porządkowych jako ilościowych w praktyce\nZe względów praktycznych często traktujemy zmienne porządkowe jak zmienne ilościowe, ponieważ:\n\nUmożliwia to stosowanie znanych operacji matematycznych (średnie, odchylenia)\nUpraszcza komunikację i interpretację wyników (“średni wynik 78%”)\nPozwala na stosowanie bardziej zaawansowanych metod statystycznych\n\nPrzykład: Średnia ocen\n\nObliczamy średnią, przypisując wartości liczbowe ocenom (5, 4, 3, 2, 1)\nTraktujemy te wartości jak zmienne ilościowe, obliczając np. średnią 4,5\nAle czy różnica między oceną 5 a 4 (5-4=1) reprezentuje taką samą różnicę wiedzy jak między oceną 2 a 1 (2-1=1)?\nI czy średnia 5.0 jest naprawdę “dwa razy lepsza” niż średnia 2.5?\n\nInny przykład: Skale Likerta\n\nW ankietach często stosujemy skale typu: 1 = “zdecydowanie nie zgadzam się”, 5 = “zdecydowanie zgadzam się”\nObliczamy średnie odpowiedzi, zakładając równe odstępy między kategoriami\nAle czy odległość między “zdecydowanie nie zgadzam się” a “raczej nie zgadzam się” jest naprawdę taka sama jak między “raczej zgadzam się” a “zdecydowanie zgadzam się”?\n\n\n\nZnaczenie rozróżnienia skal pomiarowych\nRozumienie typologii skal pomiarowych Stevensa ma istotne konsekwencje praktyczne:\n\nZmienne jakościowe porządkowe: Pozwalają na stwierdzenie, że coś jest “większe/lepsze” lub “mniejsze/gorsze”, ale nie określają “o ile” (dopuszczalne porównania typu &gt;, &lt;, =)\nZmienne ilościowe: Pozwalają na określenie dokładnych różnic i proporcji (dopuszczalne operacje +, -, ×, ÷)\n\nŚwiadomość ograniczeń skali pomiarowej pomaga w poprawnej interpretacji danych i doborze odpowiednich metod analizy.\nPrzykład: Jeśli Anna uzyskała 75 punktów na teście z historii i 85 punktów na teście z matematyki, nie możemy jednoznacznie stwierdzić, że jest “lepsza z matematyki o 10 jednostek umiejętności”. Punkty z różnych testów nie są bezpośrednio porównywalne, a interwały mogą nie być równoważne.\nPoprawniejsze podejście: Lepiej porównać jej wyniki z rozkładem wyników innych uczniów. Jeśli w historii 75 punktów plasuje ją w 50. percentylu, a 85 punktów z matematyki w 90. percentylu, to możemy powiedzieć, że względnie rzecz biorąc, radzi sobie lepiej z matematyką niż historią - co jest wnioskiem opartym na skali porządkowej.\n\n\nPodsumowanie\nChociaż skale Likerta i wiele miar psychologicznych jest często traktowanych jako dane interwałowe ze względów praktycznych, ważne jest, aby pamiętać o ich porządkowym charakterze.\n\n\n\nhttps://individual-psychometrics.rbind.io/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nĆwiczenie: Identyfikacja Skal Pomiarowych\n\n\n\nDla każdej z poniższych zmiennych określ najbardziej odpowiednią skalę pomiaru (Nominalna, Porządkowa, Przedziałowa lub Stosunkowa). Czy zmienna jest dyskretna, czy ciągła?\n\nPłeć: skala nominalna; zmienna dyskretna;\nSatysfakcja klienta: Niska, Średnia, Dobra, Doskonała\nWzrost (ankieta): “Jestem: bardzo niski, niski, przeciętnego wzrostu, wysoki, bardzo wysoki”\nWzrost mierzony w centymetrach\nCzas reakcji (w milisekundach)\nKody pocztowe: np. 00-001, 00-950, 80-452, 31-072\nWiek (w latach)\nMarki samochodów\nNarodowość\nLiczba dzieci w rodzinie: 1 dziecko, 2 dzieci, 3 dzieci, …\nWynik testu IQ\nTemperatura (skala Celsjusza)\nTemperatura (skala Kelvina)\nFrekwencja wyborcza\nPrzynależność partyjna\nWielkość okręgu wyborczego\nWspółrzędne w układzie kartezjańskim\nData (względem określonej epoki, np. n.e.)\nWysokość nad poziomem morza\nGrupy krwi: A, B, AB, 0\nKategorie dochodów: niskie, średnie, wysokie\nStopnie wojskowe\n\nPamiętaj, aby uzasadnić swój wybór skali dla każdej zmiennej.\nDla przykładu: W typologii skal pomiarowych Stevensa, adresy uliczne są danymi nominalnymi. Dlaczego?\nPełnią wyłącznie funkcję etykiet/identyfikatorów Nie mają naturalnego uporządkowania (ul. Mickiewicza 5 nie jest “większa” niż ul. Słowackiego 10) Nie można wykonywać na nich sensownych operacji matematycznych Jedyna dozwolona operacja to sprawdzanie równości/nierówności (czy to ten sam adres czy inny?)\nMimo że numery domów są liczbami, w systemie adresowym funkcjonują jako etykiety, a nie wartości ilościowe. Liczba 100 w adresie “ul. Kilińskiego 100” nie jest używana matematycznie - równie dobrze mogłaby to być “ul. Jabłkowa” czy “ul. Zeusa”, jeśli chodzi o jej funkcję w adresie.",

They can occur due to:\n\nMeasurement or recording errors\nGenuine extreme values in the population\n\nOutliers can have a substantial effect on many statistical measures, especially those based on means or sums of squared deviations. Therefore, it’s essential to:\n\nIdentify outliers through both statistical methods and domain knowledge\nInvestigate the cause of outliers\nMake informed decisions about whether to include or exclude them in analyses\n\nThroughout this guide, we’ll discuss how different descriptive measures are affected by outliers.",

    "text": "5.6 Measures of Central Tendency\nMeasures of central tendency aim to identify the “typical” or “central” value in a dataset. The three primary measures are mean, median, and mode.\n\nArithmetic Mean\nThe arithmetic mean is the sum of all values divided by the number of values.\nFormula: \\bar{x} = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i\nImportant Property: The mean is a balancing point in the data. The sum of deviations from the mean is always zero:\n\\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \\bar{x}) = 0\nThis property makes the mean useful in many statistical calculations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnderstanding Mean as a Balance Point 🎯\n\n\n\nLet’s consider a dataset X = \\{1, 2, 6, 7, 9\\} on a number line, imagining it as a seesaw:\n\n\n\nhttps://www.gastonsanchez.com/matrix4sl/mean-as-a-balancing-point.html\n\n\nThe mean (\\mu) acts as the perfect balance point of this seesaw. For our data:\n\\mu = \\frac{1 + 2 + 6 + 7 + 9}{5} = 5\n\nWhat happens at different support points? 🤔\n\nSupport point at 6 (too high):\n\nLeft side: Values (1, 2) are below\nRight side: Values (7, 9) are above\n\\sum distances from left = (6-1) + (6-2) = 9\n\\sum distances from right = (7-6) + (9-6) = 4\nThe seesaw tilts left! ⬅️ because 9 &gt; 4\n\nSupport point at 4 (too low):\n\nLeft side: Values (1, 2) are below\nRight side: Values (6, 7, 9) are above\n\\sum distances from left = (4-1) + (4-2) = 5\n\\sum distances from right = (6-4) + (7-4) + (9-4) = 10\nThe seesaw tilts right! ➡️ because 5 &lt; 10\n\nSupport point at mean (5) (perfect balance):\n\n\\sum distances below = \\sum distances above\n((5-1) + (5-2)) = ((6-5) + (7-5) + (9-5))\n7 = 7 ✨ Perfect balance!\n\n\nThis shows why the mean is the unique balance point, where:\n\\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \\mu) = 0\nThe seesaw will always tilt unless the support point is placed exactly at the mean! 🎪\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMean as a Balance Point\n\n\n\nThis visualization shows how the arithmetic mean (5) acts as a balance point between clustered points on the left and dispersed points on the right:\nLeft side of the mean: - Points with values 2 and 3 - Close together (difference of 1 unit) - Distances from mean: 3 and 2 units - Sum of “pull” = 5 units\nRight side of the mean: - Points with values 6 and 9 - More spread out (difference of 3 units) - Distances from mean: 1 and 4 units - Sum of “pull” = 5 units\nKey observations:\n\nThe mean (5) is a balance point, even though:\n\nPoints on the left are clustered (2,3)\nPoints on the right are dispersed (6,9)\nGreen arrows show distances from the mean\n\nBalance is maintained because:\n\nSum of distances balances out: (5-2) + (5-3) = (6-5) + (9-5)\nTotal sum of distances = 5 units on each side\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nManual Calculation Example:\nLet’s calculate the mean for the dataset: 2, 4, 4, 5, 5, 7, 9\n\n\n\nStep\nDescription\nCalculation\n\n\n\n\n1\nSum all values\n2 + 4 + 4 + 5 + 5 + 7 + 9 = 36\n\n\n2\nCount the number of values\nn = 7\n\n\n3\nDivide the sum by n\n36 / 7 = 5.14\n\n\n\nR calculation:\n\ndata &lt;- c(2, 4, 4, 5, 5, 7, 9)\nmean(data)\n\n[1] 5.142857\n\n\nPros:\n\nEasy to calculate and understand\nUses all data points\nUseful for further statistical calculations\n\nCons:\n\nSensitive to outliers\nNot ideal for skewed distributions\n\nExample with outlier:\n\ndata_with_outlier &lt;- c(2, 4, 4, 5, 5, 7, 100)\nmean(data_with_outlier)\n\n[1] 18.14286\n\n\nAs we can see, the outlier (100) drastically affects the mean.\n\n\nMedian\nThe median is the middle value when the data is ordered.\nManual Calculation Example:\nUsing the same dataset: 2, 4, 4, 5, 5, 7, 9\n\n\n\nStep\nDescription\nResult\n\n\n\n\n1\nOrder the data\n2, 4, 4, 5, 5, 7, 9\n\n\n2\nFind the middle value\n5\n\n\n\nFor even number of values, take the average of the two middle values.\nR calculation:\n\ndata &lt;- c(2, 4, 4, 5, 5, 7, 9)\nmedian(data)\n\n[1] 5\n\nmedian(data_with_outlier)\n\n[1] 5\n\n\nPros:\n\nNot affected by extreme outliers\nBetter for skewed distributions\n\nCons:\n\nDoesn’t use all data points\nLess useful for further statistical calculations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nTo find the position of the median in a dataset:\n\nFirst sort the data in ascending order\nIf n is odd:\n\nMedian position = \\frac{n + 1}{2}\n\nIf n is even:\n\nFirst median position = \\frac{n}{2}\nSecond median position = \\frac{n}{2} + 1\nMedian = \\frac{\\text{value at }\\frac{n}{2} + \\text{value at }(\\frac{n}{2}+1)}{2}\n\n\nFor example:\n\nOdd n=7: position = \\frac{7+1}{2} = 4th value\nEven n=8: positions = \\frac{8}{2} = 4th and 4+1 = 5th value\n\n\n\n\n\nMode\nThe mode is the most frequently occurring value.\nManual Calculation Example:\nUsing the dataset: 2, 4, 4, 5, 5, 7, 9\n\n\n\nValue\nFrequency\n\n\n\n\n2\n1\n\n\n4\n2\n\n\n5\n2\n\n\n7\n1\n\n\n9\n1\n\n\n\nThe mode is 4 and 5 (bimodal).\nR calculation:\n\nlibrary(modeest)\nmfv(data)  # Most frequent value\n\n[1] 4 5\n\n\nPros:\n\nOnly measure of central tendency for nominal data\nCan identify multiple peaks in the data\n\nCons:\n\nNot always uniquely defined\nNot useful for continuous data\n\n\n\nWeighted (arithmetic) Mean (*)\nThe weighted mean is used when some data points are more important than others. There are two types of weighted means: with not normalized weights and with normalized weights.\n\nWeighted Mean with Not Normalized Weights\nThis is the standard form of the weighted mean, where weights can be any positive numbers representing the importance of each data point.\nFormula: \\bar{x}_w = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n w_i x_i}{\\sum_{i=1}^n w_i}\nManual Calculation Example:\nLet’s calculate the weighted mean for the dataset: 2, 4, 5, 7 with weights 1, 2, 3, 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep\nDescription\nCalculation\n\n\n\n\n1\nMultiply each value by its weight\n(2 * 1) + (4 * 2) + (5 * 3) + (7 * 1) = 2 + 8 + 15 + 7 = 32\n\n\n2\nSum the weights\n1 + 2 + 3 + 1 = 7\n\n\n3\nDivide the result from step 1 by the result from step 2\n32 / 7 = 4.57\n\n\n\nR calculation:\n\nx &lt;- c(2, 4, 5, 7)\nw &lt;- c(1, 2, 3, 1)\nweighted.mean(x, w)\n\n[1] 4.571429\n\n\n\n\nWeighted Mean with Normalized Weights (Fractions)\nIn this case, the weights are fractions that sum to 1, representing the proportion of importance for each data point.\nFormula: \\bar{x}_w = \\sum_{i=1}^n w_i x_i, where \\sum_{i=1}^n w_i = 1\nManual Calculation Example:\nLet’s calculate the weighted mean for the dataset: 2, 4, 5, 7 with normalized weights 0.1, 0.3, 0.4, 0.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep\nDescription\nCalculation\n\n\n\n\n1\nMultiply each value by its weight\n(2 * 0.1) + (4 * 0.3) + (5 * 0.4) + (7 * 0.2)\n\n\n2\nSum the results\n0.2 + 1.2 + 2.0 + 1.4 = 4.8\n\n\n\nR calculation:\n\nx &lt;- c(2, 4, 5, 7)\nw_normalized &lt;- c(0.1, 0.3, 0.4, 0.2)  # Note: these sum to 1\nsum(x * w_normalized)\n\n[1] 4.8\n\n\nPros of Weighted Means:\n\nAccount for varying importance of data points\nUseful in survey analysis with different sample sizes or importance levels\nCan adjust for unequal probabilities in sampling designs\n\nCons of Weighted Means:\n\nRequire justification for weights\nCan be misused to manipulate results\nMay be less intuitive to interpret than simple arithmetic mean",

This is a mathematical fact: \\sum(x_i - \\bar{x}) = 0\nThink of it Like This:\nIf you have 5 numbers and their mean:\n\nOnce you calculate 4 deviations from the mean\nThe 5th deviation MUST be whatever makes the sum zero\nYou don’t really have 5 independent deviations\nYou only have 4 truly “free” deviations\n\nSimple Example:\nNumbers: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10\n\nMean = 6\nDeviations: -4, -2, 0, +2, +4\nNotice they sum to zero\nIf you know any 4 deviations, the 5th is predetermined!\n\nThis is Why:\n\nWhen calculating variance: s^2 = \\frac{\\sum(x_i - \\bar{x})^2}{n-1}\nWe divide by (n-1) not n\nBecause only (n-1) deviations are truly independent\nThe last one is determined by the others\n\nDegrees of Freedom:\n\nn = number of observations\n1 = constraint (deviations must sum to zero)\nn-1 = degrees of freedom = number of truly independent deviations\n\nWhen to Use It:\n\nWhen calculating sample variance\nWhen calculating sample standard deviation\n\nWhen NOT to Use It:\n\nPopulation calculations (when you have all data)\n\nRemember:\n\nIt’s not just a statistical trick\nDeviations from the mean must sum to zero\nThis constraint costs us one degree of freedom\n\n\n\n\n\nStandard Deviation\nThe standard deviation is the square root of the variance and measures the average dispersion of the data about their arithmetic mean. In contrast to the variance, it has the advantage of being expressed in the same units as the original measurements, making its interpretation more intuitive.\nFormula: s = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \\bar{x})^2}{n - 1}}\nManual Calculation Example:\nUsing the dataset: 2, 4, 4, 5, 5, 7, 9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep\nDescription\nCalculation\n\n\n\n\n1\nCalculate the variance\ns^2 = 5.14 (from previous calculation)\n\n\n2\nTake the square root\ns = \\sqrt{5.14} = 2.27\n\n\n\nR calculation:\n\nsd(data)\n\n[1] 2.267787\n\n\nPros:\n\nIn same units as original data\nWidely used and understood\n\nCons:\n\nStill sensitive to outliers\nAssumes data is roughly “normally” distributed\n\n\n\nCoefficient of Variation (*)\nThe coefficient of variation is the standard deviation divided by the mean, often expressed as a percentage.\nFormula: CV = \\frac{s}{\\bar{x}} \\times 100\\%\nManual Calculation Example:\nUsing the dataset: 2, 4, 4, 5, 5, 7, 9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep\nDescription\nCalculation\n\n\n\n\n1\nCalculate the mean\n\\bar{x} = 5.14\n\n\n2\nCalculate the standard deviation\ns = 2.27\n\n\n3\nDivide s by the mean and multiply by 100\n(2.27 / 5.14) * 100 = 44.16\\%\n\n\n\nR calculation:\n\n(sd(data) / mean(data)) * 100\n\n[1] 44.09586\n\n\nPros:\n\nAllows comparison of variability between datasets with different units or means\nUseful in fields like finance for risk assessment\n\nCons:\n\nNot meaningful for data with both positive and negative values\nCan be misleading when mean is close to zero\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLimitations of Coefficient of Variation (CV)\n\n\n\nThe coefficient of variation, calculated as (σ/μ) × 100\\%, has two important limitations:\n\nNot meaningful for data with both positive and negative values\n\nThe mean could be close to zero due to positive and negative values cancelling out\nExample: Dataset {-5, -3, 2, 6} has mean = 0\n\nCV = (std dev / 0) × 100%\nThis leads to division by zero\nEven if mean isn’t exactly zero, the CV doesn’t represent true relative variability when data cross zero\n\nThe CV assumes a natural zero point and meaningful ratios between values\n\n\n\nMisleading when mean is close to zero\n\nSince CV = (σ/μ) × 100\\%, as μ approaches zero:\n\nThe denominator becomes very small\nResults in extremely large CV values\nThese large values don’t meaningfully represent relative variability\n\nExample:\n\nDataset A: {0.001, 0.002, 0.003} has mean = 0.002\nEven small standard deviations will produce very large CVs\nThe resulting large CV might suggest extreme variability when the data are actually quite close together\n\n\n\n\nBest Use Cases\nCV is most useful for:\n\nStrictly positive data\nData measured on a ratio scale\nData with means well above zero\nComparing variability between datasets with different units or scales",

Mcgraw-Hill.\n\n\n\nWhat Are Quartiles?\nFirst Quartile (Q1):\n\nSeparates the lowest 25% of data from the rest\nAlso called the 25th percentile\nExample: If Q1 = 50 in a test score dataset, 25% of students scored below 50\n\nSecond Quartile (Q2):\n\nThe median - splits data in half\nAlso called the 50th percentile\nExample: If Q2 = 70, half the students scored below 70\n\nThird Quartile (Q3):\n\nSeparates the highest 25% of data from the rest\nAlso called the 75th percentile\nExample: If Q3 = 85, 75% of students scored below 85\n\n\n\nHow to Calculate Quartiles (Step by Step) - Two Methods\nLet’s examine student test scores using both common quartile calculation methods:\nExample 1: Odd Number Case (11 scores)\n60, 65, 70, 72, 75, 78, 80, 82, 85, 88, 90\nStep 1: Find Q2 (median) - Same for both methods\n\nWith n = 11 values (odd)\nMedian position = (n + 1)/2 = 6\nQ2 = 78\n\nStep 2: Find Q1\n\nTukey’s Method:\n\nLook at lower half: 60, 65, 70, 72, 75\nQ1 = median of lower half = 70\n\nInterpolation Method:\n\nPosition = (n + 1)/4 = (11 + 1)/4 = 3\nQ1 = 70 (3rd value)\n\n\nStep 3: Find Q3\n\nTukey’s Method:\n\nLook at upper half: 80, 82, 85, 88, 90\nQ3 = median of upper half = 85\n\nInterpolation Method:\n\nPosition = 3(n + 1)/4 = 3(12)/4 = 9\nQ3 = 85 (9th value)\n\n\nExample 2: Even Number Case (10 scores)\n60, 65, 70, 72, 75, 78, 80, 82, 85, 90\nStep 1: Find Q2 (median) - Same for both methods\n\nWith n = 10 values (even)\nMedian positions = 5 and 6\nQ2 = (75 + 78)/2 = 76.5\n\nStep 2: Find Q1\n\nTukey’s Method:\n\nLook at lower half: 60, 65, 70, 72, 75\nQ1 = median of lower half = 70\n\nInterpolation Method:\n\nPosition = (10 + 1)/4 = 2.75\nQ1 = 65 + 0.75(70 - 65) = 68.75\n\n\nStep 3: Find Q3\n\nTukey’s Method:\n\nLook at upper half: 78, 80, 82, 85, 90\nQ3 = median of upper half = 82\n\nInterpolation Method:\n\nPosition = 3(10 + 1)/4 = 8.25\nQ3 = 82 + 0.25(85 - 82) = 82.75\n\n\nImportant Notes:\n\nTukey’s Method:\n\nFirst find the median (Q2)\nSplit the data into lower and upper halves\nFind Q1 as the median of the lower half\nFind Q3 as the median of the upper half\nWhen n is odd, the median is not included in either half\n\nInterpolation Method:\n\nUses positions (n+1)/4 for Q1 and 3(n+1)/4 for Q3\nWhen position falls between values, uses linear interpolation\nDoesn’t require splitting data into halves\n\n\nBoth methods give the same results for simple positions (Example 1) but can differ when interpolation is needed (Example 2).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nManual Construction of Tukey Boxplot\n\n\n\nStep 1: Calculate Key Components\n\nFind quartiles: Q_1, Q_2 (median), Q_3\nCalculate Interquartile Range: IQR = Q_3 - Q_1\n\nStep 2: Determine Whisker Boundaries\n\nLower fence: Q_1 - 1.5 \\times IQR\nUpper fence: Q_3 + 1.5 \\times IQR\n\nStep 3: Identify Outliers Data points are outliers if they are:\n\nBelow lower fence: x &lt; Q_1 - 1.5 \\times IQR\nAbove upper fence: x &gt; Q_3 + 1.5 \\times IQR\n\nExample: Given data: 2, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 16, 50\n\nFind quartiles:\n\nQ_1 = 6\nQ_2 = 10\nQ_3 = 14\n\nCalculate IQR:\n\nIQR = 14 - 6 = 8\n\nCalculate fences:\n\nLower: 6 - (1.5 \\times 8) = -6\nUpper: 14 + (1.5 \\times 8) = 26\n\nIdentify outliers:\n\n50 &gt; 26, therefore 50 is an outlier\n\n\nGraphical Elements:\n\nBox: Draw from Q_1 to Q_3\nLine inside box: Draw at Q_2\nWhiskers: Extend to most extreme non-outlier points\nPoints: Plot outliers individually beyond whiskers\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPercentiles: A More Precise Measure of Relative Standing (*)\n\nWhat Are Percentiles?\nPercentiles give us a more detailed view by dividing data into 100 equal parts.\nKey Points:\n\nThe 25th percentile equals Q1\nThe 50th percentile equals Q2 (median)\nThe 75th percentile equals Q3\n\n\n\nCalculating Percentiles\nThe Formula: P_k = \\frac{k(n+1)}{100}\nWhere:\n\nP_k is the position for the kth percentile\nk is the percentile we want (1-100)\nn is the number of observations\n\nExample 3: Finding the 60th Percentile Let’s use student homework scores: 72, 75, 78, 80, 82, 85, 88, 90, 92, 95\nStep 1: Calculate position\n\nn = 10 scores\nFor 60th percentile: P_{60} = \\frac{60(10+1)}{100} = 6.6\n\nStep 2: Find surrounding values\n\nPosition 6: score of 85\nPosition 7: score of 88\n\nStep 3: Interpolate (important: percentiles use linear interpolation)\n\nWe need to go 0.6 of the way between 85 and 88 P_{60} = 85 + 0.6(88-85) P_{60} = 85 + 0.6(3) P_{60} = 85 + 1.8 = 86.8\n\nWhat this means: 60% of students scored 86.8 or below.\n\n\n\nPercentile Ranks (PR) (*)\n\nWhat is a Percentile Rank?\nWhile percentiles tell us the value at a certain position, percentile rank tells us what percentage of values fall below a specific score. Think of it as answering the question “What percentage of the class did I score higher than?”\nPR = \\frac{\\text{number of values below } + 0.5 \\times \\text{number of equal values}}{\\text{total number of values}} \\times 100\nExample 4: Finding a Percentile Rank Consider these exam scores:\n65, 70, 70, 75, 75, 75, 80, 85, 85, 90\nLet’s find the PR for a score of 75.\nStep 1: Count carefully\n\nValues below 75: 65, 70, 70 (3 values)\nValues equal to 75: 75, 75, 75 (3 values)\nTotal values: 10\n\nStep 2: Apply the formula\nPR = \\frac{3 + 0.5(3)}{10} \\times 100 PR = \\frac{3 + 1.5}{10} \\times 100 PR = \\frac{4.5}{10} \\times 100 = 45\\%\nInterpretation: A score of 75 is higher than 45% of the class scores.\nRemark:\nQ1: “Why do we use 0.5 for equal values in PR?”\nA1: This is because we’re assuming people with the same score are evenly spread across that position. It’s like saying they share the position equally.\n\n\n\nUnderstanding and Interpreting Box Plots\nBox plots (also known as box-and-whisker plots) are powerful visualization tools for understanding data distributions. In this section, we’ll explore how to construct and interpret box plots using height measurements from two groups.\n\nConstruction of the Tukey Box Plot\nThe box plot was introduced by John Tukey as part of his exploratory data analysis toolkit. It provides a standardized way of displaying the distribution of data based on a five-number summary.\n\nThe Five-Number Summary\nA box plot represents five key statistical values:\n\nMinimum: The smallest value in the dataset (excluding outliers)\nFirst Quartile (Q1): The 25th percentile, below which 25% of observations fall\nMedian (Q2): The 50th percentile, which divides the dataset into two equal halves\nThird Quartile (Q3): The 75th percentile, below which 75% of observations fall\nMaximum: The largest value in the dataset (excluding outliers)\n\n\n\nBox Plot Components\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.2: Boxplot diagram showing its key components.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe components of a box plot include:\n\nThe Box:\n\nRepresents the interquartile range (IQR), containing the middle 50% of the data\nLower edge represents Q1\nUpper edge represents Q3\nLine inside the box represents the median (Q2)\n\nThe Whiskers:\n\nExtend from the box to show the range of non-outlier data\nIn a Tukey box plot, whiskers extend up to 1.5 × IQR from the box edges:\n\nLower whisker: extends to the minimum value ≥ (Q1 - 1.5 × IQR)\nUpper whisker: extends to the maximum value ≤ (Q3 + 1.5 × IQR)\n\n\nOutliers:\n\nPoints that fall beyond the whiskers\nIndividually plotted as dots or symbols\nValues that are &lt; (Q1 - 1.5 × IQR) or &gt; (Q3 + 1.5 × IQR)\n\n\n\n\nKey Features to Observe\nWhen interpreting box plots, look for these characteristics:\n\nCentral Tendency: Location of the median line within the box\nDispersion: Width of the box (IQR) and length of the whiskers\nSkewness:\n\nSymmetrical data: median is approximately in the middle of the box, whiskers are roughly equal in length\nRight (positive) skew: median is closer to the bottom of the box, upper whisker is longer\nLeft (negative) skew: median is closer to the top of the box, lower whisker is longer\n\nOutliers: Presence of individual points beyond the whiskers\n\n\n\n\nCase Study: Comparing Heights Between Groups\nLet’s apply our understanding of box plots to a real dataset. We have height measurements (in centimeters) from two groups of 25 students each.\n\n# Create the dataset\ndata_height &lt;- data.frame(\n  group_1 = c(150, 160, 165, 168, 172, 173, 175, 176, 177, 178, 179, 180, 180, 181, 181, 182, 182, 183, 183, 184, 186, 188, 190, 191, 200),\n  group_2 = c(138, 140, 148, 152, 164, 164, 165, 165, 166, 166, 170, 175, 175, 175, 182, 182, 182, 182, 182, 182, 183, 183, 183, 188, 210)\n)\n\n# Transform dataset from wide to long format\ndata_height_l &lt;- gather(data = data_height, key = \"Group_number\", value = \"height\", group_1:group_2)\n\n# Display the first few rows\nhead(data_height_l)\n\n  Group_number height\n1      group_1    150\n2      group_1    160\n3      group_1    165\n4      group_1    168\n5      group_1    172\n6      group_1    173\n\n\nLet’s calculate some summary statistics for each group:\n\n# Calculate summary statistics for each group\ngroup1_stats &lt;- summary(data_height$group_1)\ngroup2_stats &lt;- summary(data_height$group_2)\n\n# Calculate IQR\ngroup1_iqr &lt;- IQR(data_height$group_1)\ngroup2_iqr &lt;- IQR(data_height$group_2)\n\n# Create a comparison table\nstats_table &lt;- rbind(\n  group1_stats,\n  group2_stats\n)\nrownames(stats_table) &lt;- c(\"Group 1\", \"Group 2\")\n\n# Display the table\nstats_table\n\n        Min. 1st Qu.

For each statement, provide a brief explanation based on evidence from the visualizations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise Questions\n\n\n\n\nStudents from group 2 (G2) in the studied sample are, on average, taller than those from group 1 (G1).\nGroup 1 (G1) height measurements are more dispersed/spread out than group 2 (G2).\nThe lowest person is in group 2 (G2).\nBoth data sets are negatively (left) skewed.\nHalf of the students in group 2 (G2) measure at least 175 cm.\n\n\n\n\nHints for Interpretation\nWhen answering these questions, consider:\n\nThe position of the median line within each box\nThe relative sizes of the boxes (IQR)\nThe positions of the minimum and maximum values\nThe symmetry of the distributions (balanced or skewed)\nThe lengths of the whiskers\n\nFor each statement, determine whether it is True or False and provide your explanation:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer Template\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStudents from G2 are, on average, taller than G1: [True/False]\n\nExplanation:\n\nG1 height is more dispersed/spread out: [True/False]\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe lowest person is in G2: [True/False]\n\nExplanation:\n\nBoth data sets are negatively (left) skewed: [True/False]\n\nExplanation:\n\nHalf of G2 measure at least 175 cm: [True/False]\n\nExplanation:\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s review the answers to our box plot interpretation questions:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolutions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStudents from G2 are, on average, taller than G1: False\n\nExplanation: The median height (middle line in the boxplot) for G1 is higher than G2.\n\nG1 height is more dispersed/spread out: False\n\nExplanation: G2 shows greater dispersion. This is visible in the boxplot where G2 has a larger interquartile range (IQR) of 17.5 cm compared to G1’s 9.5 cm. G2 also has a wider range from minimum to maximum values.\n\nThe lowest person is in G2: True\n\nExplanation: The minimum value in G2 is 138 cm, which is lower than the minimum value in G1 (150 cm).\n\nBoth data sets are negatively (left) skewed: True\n\nExplanation: In both groups, the median line is positioned toward the upper part of the box, and the lower whisker is longer than the upper whisker. This indicates that there’s a longer tail on the left side of the distribution, which means negative skewness.\n\nHalf of G2 measure at least 175 cm: True\n\nExplanation: The median (middle line in the boxplot) for G2 is 175 cm, which means that 50% of the values are greater than or equal to 175 cm.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR Code Reference\nHere’s the complete R code used in this section:\n\n# Load required packages\nlibrary(tidyr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(ggpubr)\n\n# Set display options\noptions(scipen = 999, digits = 3)\n\n# Create the dataset\ndata_height &lt;- data.frame(\n  group_1 = c(150, 160, 165, 168, 172, 173, 175, 176, 177, 178, 179, 180, 180, 181, 181, 182, 182, 183, 183, 184, 186, 188, 190, 191, 200),\n  group_2 = c(138, 140, 148, 152, 164, 164, 165, 165, 166, 166, 170, 175, 175, 175, 182, 182, 182, 182, 182, 182, 183, 183, 183, 188, 210)\n)\n\n# Transform dataset from wide to long format\ndata_height_l &lt;- gather(data = data_height, key = \"Group_number\", value = \"height\", group_1:group_2)\n\n# Display the first few rows\nhead(data_height_l)\n\n# Calculate summary statistics for each group\ngroup1_stats &lt;- summary(data_height$group_1)\ngroup2_stats &lt;- summary(data_height$group_2)\n\n# Calculate IQR\ngroup1_iqr &lt;- IQR(data_height$group_1)\ngroup2_iqr &lt;- IQR(data_height$group_2)\n\n# Create horizontal boxplots\nggplot(data = data_height_l) + \n  geom_boxplot(aes(x = Group_number, y = height, colour = Group_number), notch = FALSE) + \n  coord_flip() + \n  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(130, 210, 5)) + \n  theme_pubr() + \n  grids(linetype = \"dashed\") +\n  labs(title = \"Height Distribution by Group\",\n       x = \"Group\",\n       y = \"Height (cm)\")\n\n# Create density plots\nggplot(data = data_height_l) + \n  geom_density(aes(x = height, fill = Group_number), alpha = 0.5) + \n  facet_grid(~ Group_number) + \n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(130, 210, 10)) +\n  labs(title = \"Height Density by Group\",\n       x = \"Height (cm)\",\n       y = \"Density\")",

    "text": "6.4 Wartości Odstające (Outliers)\nPrzed zagłębieniem się w konkretne miary, kluczowe jest zrozumienie pojęcia wartości odstających, ponieważ mogą one znacząco wpływać na wiele statystyk opisowych.\nWartości odstające to punkty danych, które znacznie różnią się od innych obserwacji w zbiorze danych. Mogą wystąpić z powodu:\n\nBłędów pomiaru lub zapisu\nPrawdziwych ekstremalnych wartości w populacji\n\nWartości odstające mogą mieć istotny wpływ na wiele miar statystycznych, szczególnie tych opartych na średnich lub sumach kwadratów odchyleń. Dlatego ważne jest, aby:\n\nIdentyfikować wartości odstające zarówno poprzez metody statystyczne, jak i wiedzę dziedzinową\nBadać przyczyny wartości odstających\nPodejmować świadome decyzje o tym, czy włączać je do analiz, czy nie",

We’ll explore these concepts with practical examples using the ggplot2 library in R.\nFirst, let’s load the necessary libraries:\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(tidyr)\nlibrary(scales)",

    "text": "7.2 Bar Plots\nBar plots are excellent for displaying categorical data or summarizing continuous data by groups.\n\nUnderstanding Bar Plots\nA bar plot represents data using rectangular bars with heights proportional to the values they represent. They are used to compare different categories or groups.\nKey components of a bar plot: 1. X-axis: Represents categories 2. Y-axis: Represents values (can be counts, percentages, or any numerical value) 3. Bars: Rectangle for each category, height corresponds to its value\n\nExample Data\nLet’s use a simple dataset of fruit sales:\n\nfruits &lt;- c(\"Apple\", \"Banana\", \"Orange\", \"Grape\")\nsales &lt;- c(120, 85, 70, 100)\n\n# Create a data frame\ndf &lt;- data.frame(fruit = fruits, sales = sales)\n\n\n\n\nHand-Drawn Bar Plot\nTo create a bar plot by hand:\n\nDraw a horizontal line (x-axis) and a vertical line (y-axis) perpendicular to each other.\nLabel the x-axis with your categories (fruits), evenly spaced.\nLabel the y-axis with a suitable scale for your values (sales, 0 to 120 in increments of 20).\nFor each category, draw a rectangle (bar) whose height corresponds to its value on the y-axis scale.\nColor or shade each bar if desired.\nAdd a title and labels for both axes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nWhen drawing by hand, use graph paper for more precise measurements and straighter lines. Choose a scale that allows all your data to fit while maximizing the use of space.\n\n\n\n\nBar Plot in Base R\n\n# Create bar plot\nbarplot(sales, names.arg = fruits, \n        main = \"Fruit Sales\",\n        xlab = \"Fruit Types\", ylab = \"Sales\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBar Plot with ggplot2\n\n# Create bar plot with ggplot2\nggplot(df, aes(x = fruit, y = sales)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", fill = \"skyblue\") +\n  labs(title = \"Fruit Sales\",\n       x = \"Fruit Types\", y = \"Sales\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterpreting Bar Plots\nWhen interpreting a bar plot, consider the following:\n\nRelative Heights: Compare the heights of the bars to understand which categories have higher or lower values.\nOrdering: Sometimes, bars are ordered by height to make comparisons easier.\nPatterns: Look for any patterns or trends across categories.\nOutliers: Identify any bars that are much taller or shorter than the others.\n\n\nExample Interpretation\nFor our fruit sales data:\n\nApples have the highest sales (120), followed by Grapes (100).\nOranges have the lowest sales (70).\nThere’s a considerable difference between the highest (Apples) and lowest (Oranges) sales.\nBananas and Grapes have similar sales figures, in the middle range.\n\nThis information could be useful for inventory management or marketing strategies in a fruit shop.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nBar plots are great for comparing categories, but they don’t show the distribution within each category. For that, you might need other plot types like box plots.",

    "section": "7.3 Histograms",
    "text": "7.3 Histograms\nHistograms visualize the distribution of a continuous variable by dividing it into intervals (bins) and showing the frequency or density of data points in each bin.\n\nUnderstanding Histograms\nKey components of a histogram: 1. X-axis: Represents the variable’s values, divided into bins 2. Y-axis: Represents frequency, relative frequency, or density 3. Bars: Rectangle for each bin, height corresponds to the y-axis measure\nThere are three main types of histograms:\n\nFrequency Histogram: The y-axis shows the count of data points in each bin.\nRelative Frequency Histogram: The y-axis shows the proportion of data points in each bin (frequency divided by total number of data points).\nDensity Histogram: The y-axis shows the density, which is the relative frequency divided by the bin width.

    "text": "7.4 Box Plots and Tukey Box Plots\nBox plots, also known as box-and-whisker plots, provide a concise summary of a distribution. We’ll focus on the Tukey-style box plot, named after the statistician John Tukey who popularized this type of plot.\n\nUnderstanding Box Plots\nA box plot represents five key statistics:\n\nMinimum value (excluding outliers)\nFirst quartile (Q1)\nMedian\nThird quartile (Q3)\nMaximum value (excluding outliers)\n\nAdditionally, box plots show:\n\nWhiskers: Lines extending from the box to the minimum and maximum values (excluding outliers)\nOutliers: Individual points beyond the whiskers\n\n\nCalculating Quartiles and Outliers\nTo create a box plot, follow these steps:\n\nOrder your data from smallest to largest.\nFind the median (middle value if odd number of data points, average of two middle values if even).\nFind Q1 (median of lower half of data) and Q3 (median of upper half of data).\nCalculate the Interquartile Range (IQR) = Q3 - Q1\nDetermine outliers using Tukey’s rule:\n\nLower outliers: &lt; Q1 - 1.5 * IQR\nUpper outliers: &gt; Q3 + 1.5 * IQR\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe factor 1.5 in Tukey’s outlier rule is based on the properties of the normal distribution. For normally distributed data, this rule identifies about 0.7% of the data as potential outliers.\n\n\n\n\nExample Data\nLet’s use a small dataset to illustrate:\n\ndata &lt;- c(2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 15, 50)\n\n\n\n\nHand-Drawn Tukey Box Plot\nTo create a Tukey box plot by hand:\n\nDraw a vertical line representing the range from minimum to maximum (2 to 15 in our example, excluding the outlier).\nDraw a box from Q1 to Q3.\nDraw a horizontal line through the box at the median.\nDraw whiskers from the box to the minimum and maximum values (excluding outliers).\nRepresent the outlier (50) as an individual point beyond the whisker.\nAdd a scale to the vertical axis and label it.\n\n\n\nBox Plot in Base R\n\n# Create box plot\nboxplot(data, main = \"Box Plot of Sample Data\",\n        ylab = \"Values\", outcol = \"red\", outpch = 20)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTukey Box Plot with ggplot2\n\n# Create a data frame\ndf &lt;- data.frame(value = data)\n\n# Create Tukey box plot with ggplot2\nggplot(df, aes(x = \"\", y = value)) +\n  stat_boxplot(geom = \"errorbar\", width = 0.2) +\n  geom_boxplot(fill = \"white\", outlier.shape = 20, outlier.color = \"red\") +\n  labs(title = \"Tukey Box Plot of Sample Data\",\n       x = \"\", y = \"Values\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.title.x = element_blank(),\n        axis.text.x = element_blank(),\n        axis.ticks.x = element_blank())\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterpreting Box Plots\nWhen interpreting a box plot, consider the following:\n\nCentral Tendency: The median shows the center of the distribution.\nSpread: The box (IQR) represents the middle 50% of the data.\nSkewness: If the median line is closer to one end of the box, the distribution is skewed.\nOutliers: Points beyond the whiskers are potential outliers.\nComparisons: When comparing multiple box plots, look at relative positions of medians, box sizes, and presence of outliers.",

    "text": "7.5 Conclusion\nIn this chapter, we explored three fundamental types of data visualizations: bar plots, histograms, and box plots. We demonstrated how to create these plots by hand, using R’s base plotting system, and using the ggplot2 library.\nEach type of plot serves a different purpose: - Bar plots are excellent for comparing categories. - Histograms show the distribution of a continuous variable. - Box plots provide a concise summary of a distribution, highlighting central tendency, spread, and outliers.\nRemember, the choice of visualization depends on your data type and the insights you want to convey. Always consider your audience and the story you want to tell with your data when selecting and designing your visualizations.\nPractice creating these plots by hand to deepen your understanding of their construction and interpretation. Then, leverage the power of R and ggplot2 to quickly create and customize these visualizations for larger datasets and more complex analyses.",

Pokazaliśmy, jak tworzyć te wykresy ręcznie, używając podstawowego systemu wykresów R oraz biblioteki ggplot2.\nKażdy typ wykresu służy innemu celowi: - Wykresy słupkowe doskonale nadają się do porównywania kategorii. - Histogramy pokazują rozkład zmiennej ciągłej. - Wykresy pudełkowe dostarczają zwięzłego podsumowania rozkładu, podkreślając tendencję centralną, rozrzut i wartości odstające.\nPamiętaj, że wybór wizualizacji zależy od typu danych i wniosków, które chcesz przekazać. Zawsze bierz pod uwagę swoją docelową grupę odbiorców i historię, którą chcesz opowiedzieć za pomocą swoich danych, wybierając i projektując wizualizacje.\nĆwicz tworzenie tych wykresów ręcznie, aby pogłębić zrozumienie ich konstrukcji i interpretacji. Następnie wykorzystaj moc R i ggplot2, aby szybko tworzyć i dostosowywać te wizualizacje dla większych zbiorów danych i bardziej złożonych analiz.",

    "text": "9.1 Introduction\nThe distinction between correlation and causation represents a fundamental challenge in statistical analysis. While correlation measures the statistical association between variables, causation implies a direct influence of one variable on another.\nStatistical relationships form the backbone of data-driven decision making across disciplines—from economics and public health to psychology and environmental science. Understanding when a relationship indicates mere association versus genuine causality is crucial for valid inference and effective policy recommendations.",

    "text": "9.10 Understanding Ordinary Least Squares (OLS): A Quick-start Guide\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnderstanding Ordinary Least Squares (OLS): A Quick-start Guide\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction: What is Regression Analysis?\nRegression analysis helps us understand and measure relationships between things we can observe. It provides mathematical tools to identify patterns in data that help us make predictions.\nConsider these research questions:\n\nHow does study time affect test scores?\nHow does experience affect salary?\nHow does advertising spending influence sales?\n\nRegression gives us systematic methods to answer these questions with real data.\n\n\nThe Starting Point: A Simple Example\nLet’s begin with something concrete. You’ve collected data from 20 students in your class:\n\n\n\nStudent\nStudy Hours\nExam Score\n\n\n\n\nAlex\n2\n68\n\n\nBeth\n4\n74\n\n\nCarlos\n6\n85\n\n\nDiana\n8\n91\n\n\n…\n…\n…\n\n\n\nWhen you plot this data, you get a scatter plot with dots all over. Your goal: find the straight line that best describes the relationship between study hours and exam scores.\nBut what does “best” mean? That’s what we’ll discover.\n\n\nWhy Real Data Doesn’t Fall on a Perfect Line\nBefore diving into the math, let’s understand why data points don’t line up perfectly.\n\nDeterministic vs. Stochastic Models\nDeterministic Models describe relationships with no uncertainty. Think of physics equations: \\text{Distance} = \\text{Speed} × \\text{Time}\nIf you drive at exactly 60 mph for exactly 2 hours, you’ll always travel exactly 120 miles. No variation, no exceptions.\nStochastic Models acknowledge that real-world data contains natural variation. The fundamental structure is: Y = f(X) + \\epsilon\nWhere:\n\nY is what we’re trying to predict (exam scores)\nf(X) is the systematic pattern (how study hours typically affect scores)\n\\epsilon (epsilon) represents all the random stuff we can’t measure\n\nIn our example, two students might study for 5 hours but get different scores because:\n\nOne slept better the night before\nOne is naturally better at test-taking\nOne had a noisy roommate during the exam\nPure chance in which questions were asked\n\nThis randomness is natural and expected - that’s what \\epsilon captures.\n\n\n\nThe Simple Linear Regression Model\nWe express the relationship between study hours and exam scores as: Y_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1X_i + \\epsilon_i\nLet’s decode this:\n\nY_i = exam score for student i\nX_i = study hours for student i\n\\beta_0 = the intercept (baseline score with zero study hours)\n\\beta_1 = the slope (points gained per study hour)\n\\epsilon_i = everything else affecting student i’s score\n\nKey insight: We never know the true values of \\beta_0 and \\beta_1. Instead, we use our data to estimate them, calling our estimates \\hat{\\beta}_0 and \\hat{\\beta}_1 (the “hats” mean “estimated”).\n\n\nUnderstanding Residuals: How Wrong Are Our Predictions?\nOnce we draw a line through our data, we can make predictions. For each student:\n\nActual score (y_i): What they really got\nPredicted score (\\hat{y}_i): What our line says they should have gotten\nResidual (e_i): The difference = Actual - Predicted\n\nVisual Example:\nDiana: Studied 8 hours, scored 91\nOur line predicts: 88 points\nResidual: 91 - 88 = +3 points (we underestimated)\n\nEric: Studied 5 hours, scored 70\nOur line predicts: 79 points  \nResidual: 70 - 79 = -9 points (we overestimated)\n\n\nThe Key Insight: Why Square the Residuals?\nHere’s a puzzle. Consider these residuals from four students:\n\nStudent A: +5 points\nStudent B: -5 points\nStudent C: +3 points\nStudent D: -3 points\n\nIf we just add them: (+5) + (-5) + (+3) + (-3) = 0\nThis suggests perfect predictions, but every prediction was wrong! The positive and negative errors canceled out.\nThe solution: Square each residual before adding:\n\nStudent A: (+5)^2 = 25\nStudent B: (-5)^2 = 25\nStudent C: (+3)^2 = 9\nStudent D: (-3)^2 = 9\nTotal squared error: 68\n\nWhy squaring works:\n\nNo more cancellation: All squared values are positive\nBigger errors matter more: A 10-point error counts 4× as much as a 5-point error\nMathematical convenience: Squared functions are smooth and differentiable\n\n\n\nThe Ordinary Least Squares Method\nOLS finds the line that minimizes the Sum of Squared Errors (SSE):\n\\text{SSE} = \\sum_{i=1}^n e_i^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2\nExpanding this: \\min_{\\beta_0, \\beta_1} \\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - (\\beta_0 + \\beta_1x_i))^2\nIn plain English: “Find the intercept and slope that make the total squared prediction error as small as possible.”\n\n\nThe Mathematical Solution (Formal Derivation)\nTo minimize SSE, we use calculus. Taking partial derivatives and setting them to zero:\n\\frac{\\partial SSE}{\\partial \\beta_0} = -2\\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \\beta_0 - \\beta_1x_i) = 0\n\\frac{\\partial SSE}{\\partial \\beta_1} = -2\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i(y_i - \\beta_0 - \\beta_1x_i) = 0\nSolving this system of equations yields:\n\\hat{\\beta}_1 = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n(x_i - \\bar{x})(y_i - \\bar{y})}{\\sum_{i=1}^n(x_i - \\bar{x})^2} = \\frac{\\text{Cov}(X, Y)}{\\text{Var}(X)}\n\\hat{\\beta}_0 = \\bar{y} - \\hat{\\beta}_1\\bar{x}\nWhere \\bar{x} and \\bar{y} are the sample means.\nWhat this tells us:\n\nThe slope depends on how X and Y vary together (covariance) relative to how much X varies alone (variance)\nThe line always passes through the center point (\\bar{x}, \\bar{y})\n\n\n\nMaking Sense of Variation: How Good Is Our Line?\nTo evaluate our model’s performance, we break down the variation in exam scores:\n\nTotal Sum of Squares (SST)\n“How much do exam scores vary overall?” SST = \\sum_{i=1}^n(y_i - \\bar{y})^2\nThis measures how spread out the scores are from the class average.\n\n\nRegression Sum of Squares (SSR)\n“How much variation does our line explain?” SSR = \\sum_{i=1}^n(\\hat{y}_i - \\bar{y})^2\nThis measures how much better our predictions are than just guessing the average for everyone.\n\n\nError Sum of Squares (SSE)\n“How much variation is left unexplained?” SSE = \\sum_{i=1}^n(y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2\nThis is the variation our model couldn’t capture (the squared residuals).\n\n\nThe Fundamental Equation\nSST = SSR + SSE \\text{Total Variation} = \\text{Explained} + \\text{Unexplained}\n\n\n\nR-Squared: The Model Report Card\nThe coefficient of determination (R²) tells us what percentage of variation our model explains:\nR^2 = \\frac{\\text{Explained Variation}}{\\text{Total Variation}} = \\frac{SSR}{SST} = 1 - \\frac{SSE}{SST}\nHow to interpret R²:\n\nR² = 0.75: “Study hours explain 75% of the variation in exam scores”\nR² = 0.30: “Our model captures 30% of what makes scores different”\nR² = 1.00: Perfect prediction (never happens with real data)\nR² = 0.00: Our line is no better than guessing the average\n\nImportant reality check: In social sciences, R² = 0.30 might be excellent. In engineering, R² = 0.95 might be the minimum acceptable. Context matters.\n\n\nInterpreting Your Results\nWhen you run OLS and get \\hat{\\beta}_0 = 60 and \\hat{\\beta}_1 = 4:\nThe Slope (\\hat{\\beta}_1 = 4):\n\n“Each additional hour of study is associated with 4 more points on the exam”\nThis is an average effect across all students\nIt’s not a guarantee for any individual student\n\nThe Intercept (\\hat{\\beta}_0 = 60):\n\n“A student who studies 0 hours is predicted to score 60”\nOften this is just a mathematical anchor point\nMay not make practical sense (who studies 0 hours?)\n\nThe Prediction Equation: \\text{Predicted Score} = 60 + 4 \\times \\text{Study Hours}\nSo a student studying 5 hours: Predicted score = 60 + 4(5) = 80 points\n\n\nEffect Size and Practical Significance\nStatistical significance tells us whether an effect exists. Practical significance tells us whether it matters. Understanding both is crucial for proper interpretation.\n\nCalculating and Interpreting Raw Effect Sizes\nThe raw (unstandardized) effect size is simply your slope coefficient \\hat{\\beta}_1.\nExample: If \\hat{\\beta}_1 = 4 points per hour:\n\nThis is the raw effect size\nInterpretation: “One hour of additional study yields 4 exam points”\n\nTo assess practical significance, consider:\n\nScale of the outcome: 4 points on a 100-point exam (4%) vs. 4 points on a 500-point exam (0.8%)\nCost of the intervention: Is one hour of study time worth 4 points?\nContext-specific thresholds: Does 4 points change a letter grade?\n\n\n\nCalculating Standardized Effect Sizes\nStandardized effects allow comparison across different scales and studies.\nFormula for standardized coefficient (beta weight): \\beta_{std} = \\hat{\\beta}_1 \\times \\frac{s_X}{s_Y}\nWhere:\n\ns_X = standard deviation of X (study hours)\ns_Y = standard deviation of Y (exam scores)\n\nStep-by-step calculation:\n\nCalculate the standard deviation of X: s_X = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum(x_i - \\bar{x})^2}{n-1}}\nCalculate the standard deviation of Y: s_Y = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum(y_i - \\bar{y})^2}{n-1}}\nMultiply: \\beta_{std} = \\hat{\\beta}_1 \\times \\frac{s_X}{s_Y}\n\nExample calculation:\n\nSuppose s_X = 2.5 hours and s_Y = 12 points\nWith \\hat{\\beta}_1 = 4: \\beta_{std} = 4 \\times \\frac{2.5}{12} = 0.83\nInterpretation: “A one standard deviation increase in study hours (2.5 hours) is associated with 0.83 standard deviations increase in exam score”\n\n\n\nCohen’s Guidelines for Effect Sizes\nFor standardized regression coefficients:\n\nSmall effect: |β| ≈ 0.10 (explains ~1% of variance)\nMedium effect: |β| ≈ 0.30 (explains ~9% of variance)\nLarge effect: |β| ≈ 0.50 (explains ~25% of variance)\n\nFor R² (proportion of variance explained):\n\nSmall effect: R² ≈ 0.02\nMedium effect: R² ≈ 0.13\nLarge effect: R² ≈ 0.26\n\nImportant: These are general benchmarks. Field-specific standards often differ:\n\nPsychology/Education: R² = 0.10 might be meaningful\nPhysics/Engineering: R² &lt; 0.90 might be unacceptable\nEconomics: R² = 0.30 might be excellent\n\n\n\nCalculating Confidence Intervals for Effect Sizes\nTo quantify uncertainty in your effect size:\nFor the raw coefficient: CI = \\hat{\\beta}_1 \\pm t_{critical} \\times SE(\\hat{\\beta}_1)\nWhere:\n\nt_{critical} = critical value from t-distribution (usually ≈ 2 for 95% CI)\nSE(\\hat{\\beta}_1) = standard error of the slope\n\nPractical interpretation: If 95% CI = [3.2, 4.8], we can say: “We’re 95% confident that each study hour adds between 3.2 and 4.8 exam points.”\n\n\nMaking Decisions About Practical Significance\nTo determine if an effect is practically significant, consider:\n\nMinimum meaningful difference: What’s the smallest effect that would matter?\n\nIn education: Often 0.25 standard deviations\nIn medicine: Determined by clinical relevance\nIn business: Based on cost-benefit analysis\n\nNumber needed to treat (NNT) analog: How much X must change for meaningful Y change?\n\nIf passing requires 10 more points and \\hat{\\beta}_1 = 4\nStudents need 2.5 more study hours to pass\n\nCost-effectiveness ratio: \\text{Efficiency} = \\frac{\\text{Effect Size}}{\\text{Cost of Intervention}}\n\nExample practical significance assessment:\n\nEffect: 4 points per study hour\nPassing threshold: 70 points\nCurrent average: 68 points\nConclusion: 30 minutes of extra study could change fail to pass\nDecision: Practically significant for borderline students\n\n\n\n\nUnderstanding Uncertainty: Nothing Is Perfect\nYour estimates come from a sample, not the entire population. This creates uncertainty.\n\nWhy We Have Uncertainty\n\nYou studied 20 students, not all students ever\nYour sample might be slightly unusual by chance\nMeasurement isn’t perfect (did students report hours accurately?)\n\n\n\nConfidence Intervals: Being Honest About Uncertainty\nInstead of saying “the effect is exactly 4 points per hour,” we say:\n\n“We estimate 4 points per hour”\n“We’re 95% confident the true effect is between 3.2 and 4.8 points”\n\nThis range (3.2 to 4.8) is called a 95% confidence interval.\nWhat it means: If we repeated this study many times with different samples, 95% of the intervals we calculate would contain the true effect.\nWhat it doesn’t mean: There’s a 95% chance the true value is in this specific interval (it either is or isn’t).\n\n\nTesting If There’s Really a Relationship\nThe big question: “Is there actually a relationship, or did we just get lucky with our sample?”\nWe test this by asking: “If study hours truly had zero effect on scores, how likely would we be to see a pattern this strong just by chance?”\nThe process (simplified):\n\nAssume there’s no relationship (the “null hypothesis”)\nCalculate how unlikely our data would be if that were true\nIf it’s very unlikely (typically less than 5% chance), we conclude there probably is a relationship\n\nP-values in plain English:\n\np = 0.03: “If study hours didn’t matter at all, there’s only a 3% chance we’d see a pattern this strong by luck”\np = 0.40: “This pattern could easily happen by chance even if there’s no real relationship”\n\nRule of thumb: p &lt; 0.05 → “statistically significant” (probably a real relationship)\n\n\n\nWhen Things Go Wrong: Model Diagnostics\n\nQuick Visual Checks\n\nPlot your data first: Does it look roughly linear?\nPlot residuals vs. predicted values: Should look like a random cloud\nLook for outliers: Any points way off from the others?\n\n\n\nWarning Signs Your Model Might Be Misleading\nPattern in residuals: If residuals show a curve or trend, you’re missing something\nIncreasing spread: If residuals get more spread out as predictions increase, standard errors might be wrong\nInfluential outliers: One or two weird points can drag your whole line off\nMissing variables: If you forgot something important (like prior knowledge), your estimates might be biased\n\n\n\nKey Assumptions: When OLS Works Well\n\nLinearity: The true relationship is approximately straight\n\nCheck: Look at your scatter plot\n\nIndependence: Each observation is separate\n\nCheck: Make sure students didn’t work together or copy\n\nConstant variance: The spread of residuals is similar everywhere\n\nCheck: Residual plot shouldn’t fan out\n\nNo perfect multicollinearity: (For multiple regression) Predictors aren’t perfectly related\n\nCheck: Make sure you didn’t include the same variable twice\n\nRandom sampling: Your data represents the population you care about\n\nCheck: Did you sample fairly?\n\n\n\n\nSummary: Your OLS Toolkit\nWhat OLS Does:\n\nFinds the straight line that minimizes squared prediction errors\nEstimates how much Y changes when X changes by one unit\nTells you how much variation your model explains (R²)\nQuantifies uncertainty in your estimates\n\nYour Step-by-Step Process:\n\nPlot your data - does a line make sense?\nRun OLS to get \\hat{\\beta}_0 and \\hat{\\beta}_1\nCheck R² - how much variation do you explain?\nCalculate effect sizes (raw and standardized)\nAssess practical significance using context-specific criteria\nLook at confidence intervals - how uncertain are you?\nCheck residuals - any obvious problems?\nMake decisions based on both statistical and practical significance\n\n\n\nKluczowe interpretacje / Key interpretations\nDomyślny model: regresja OLS Y=\\beta_0+\\beta_1 X+\\varepsilon (lub wieloraka: Y=\\beta_0+\\beta_1 X_1+\\cdots+\\beta_p X_p+\\varepsilon).\n\nNachylenie / Slope (\\beta_1) PL: Przy wzroście X o 1 jednostkę (ceteris paribus), przeciętna wartość Y zmienia się o \\beta_1 jednostek.

    "text": "9.26 The Linear Regression Model\nRegression analysis provides a statistical framework for modeling relationships between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. This methodology enables researchers to quantify relationships, test hypotheses, and make predictions based on observed data.\n\nSimple Linear Regression\nThe simple linear regression model expresses the relationship between a dependent variable and a single independent variable:\nY_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_i + \\varepsilon_i\nWhere: - Y_i represents the dependent variable for observation i - X_i represents the independent variable for observation i - \\beta_0 is the intercept parameter - \\beta_1 is the slope parameter - \\varepsilon_i is the error term for observation i\n\n\nMultiple Linear Regression\nThe multiple linear regression model extends this framework to incorporate k independent variables:\nY_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_{1i} + \\beta_2 X_{2i} + ... + \\beta_k X_{ki} + \\varepsilon_i\nThis formulation allows for the simultaneous analysis of multiple predictors and their respective contributions to the dependent variable.\n\n\nOrdinary Least Squares Estimation\n\nDefining the Optimization Criterion\nThe estimation of regression parameters requires a criterion for determining the “best” fit. Consider three potential approaches for defining the optimal line through a set of data points:\n\n\nApproach 1: Minimizing the Sum of Residuals\n\\min \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (Y_i - \\hat{Y}_i) = \\min \\sum_{i=1}^{n} e_i\nThis approach is fundamentally flawed. For any line passing through the data, we can always find another line where positive and negative residuals sum to zero. In fact, infinitely many lines satisfy \\sum e_i = 0. This criterion fails to uniquely identify an optimal solution. Moreover, a horizontal line through the mean of Y would achieve zero sum of residuals while ignoring the relationship with X entirely.\n\n\nApproach 2: Minimizing the Sum of Absolute Residuals\n\\min \\sum_{i=1}^{n} |Y_i - \\hat{Y}_i| = \\min \\sum_{i=1}^{n} |e_i|\nThis criterion, known as Least Absolute Deviations (LAD), addresses the cancellation problem by taking absolute values. It produces estimates that are more robust to outliers than OLS. However, this approach presents significant challenges:\n\nThe absolute value function is not differentiable at zero, complicating analytical solutions\nMultiple solutions may exist (the objective function may have multiple minima)\nNo closed-form solution exists; iterative numerical methods are required\nStatistical inference is more complex, lacking the elegant properties of OLS estimators\n\n\n\nApproach 3: Minimizing the Sum of Squared Residuals\n\\min \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (Y_i - \\hat{Y}_i)^2 = \\min \\sum_{i=1}^{n} e_i^2\nThe Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) approach minimizes the sum of squared residuals. This criterion offers several advantages:\n\nPrevents cancellation of positive and negative errors\nProvides a unique solution (except in cases of perfect multicollinearity)\nYields closed-form analytical solutions through differentiation\nProduces estimators with optimal statistical properties under classical assumptions\nFacilitates straightforward statistical inference\n\n\n\n\nVisualizing the Sum of Squared Errors\nThe OLS method can be understood geometrically through the following conceptual framework:\n\nEach error appears as a vertical line from the data point to the regression line\nEach of these vertical lines represents a residual (e_i)\nWe square each residual, which can be visualized as creating a square area\nThe sum of all these squared areas is what OLS minimizes\n\n\n# Visualization of squared errors as geometric areas\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n# Generate sample data with clear pattern\nset.seed(42)\nn &lt;- 8  # Small number for clarity\nx &lt;- seq(2, 16, length.out = n)\ny &lt;- 10 + 1.5*x + rnorm(n, 0, 3)\ndf &lt;- data.frame(x = x, y = y)\n\n# Fit regression model\nmodel &lt;- lm(y ~ x, df)\ndf$fitted &lt;- fitted(model)\ndf$residual &lt;- residuals(model)\n\n# Create visualization with actual squares\np &lt;- ggplot(df, aes(x = x, y = y)) +\n  # Add regression line first (bottom layer)\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE, color = \"darkblue\", linewidth = 1.2) +\n  \n  # Add squares for each residual\n  # For positive residuals\n  geom_rect(data = subset(df, residual &gt; 0),\n            aes(xmin = x - abs(residual)/2, \n                xmax = x + abs(residual)/2, \n                ymin = fitted, \n                ymax = fitted + abs(residual)),\n            fill = \"red\", alpha = 0.25, color = \"red\", linewidth = 0.5) +\n  \n  # For negative residuals  \n  geom_rect(data = subset(df, residual &lt; 0),\n            aes(xmin = x - abs(residual)/2, \n                xmax = x + abs(residual)/2, \n                ymin = fitted - abs(residual), \n                ymax = fitted),\n            fill = \"red\", alpha = 0.25, color = \"red\", linewidth = 0.5) +\n  \n  # Add residual lines\n  geom_segment(aes(xend = x, yend = fitted), \n               color = \"red\", linewidth = 0.8, linetype = \"solid\") +\n  \n  # Add data points\n  geom_point(size = 3.5, color = \"black\") +\n  \n  # Add text annotations for selected squared values\n  geom_text(data = subset(df, abs(residual) &gt; 2),\n            aes(x = x, \n                y = fitted + sign(residual) * abs(residual)/2,\n                label = paste0(\"e²=\", round(residual^2, 1))),\n            size = 3, color = \"darkred\", fontface = \"italic\") +\n  \n  # Styling\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(face = \"italic\")\n  ) +\n  coord_equal() +  # Ensures squares appear as squares\n  labs(\n    title = \"Geometric Visualization of Sum of Squared Errors\",\n    subtitle = paste(\"SSE =\", round(sum(df$residual^2), 1), \n                     \"- Red squares represent squared residuals\"),\n    x = \"Independent Variable (X)\",\n    y = \"Dependent Variable (Y)\"\n  ) +\n  # Add SSE annotation\n  annotate(\"rect\", \n           xmin = max(df$x) - 3, xmax = max(df$x) - 0.5,\n           ymin = min(df$y) - 2, ymax = min(df$y),\n           fill = \"lightyellow\", alpha = 0.8, color = \"gray40\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", \n           x = max(df$x) - 1.75, y = min(df$y) - 1,\n           label = paste(\"Σe² =\", round(sum(df$residual^2), 1)),\n           size = 4, fontface = \"bold\", color = \"darkred\")\n\nprint(p)\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMathematical Derivation of OLS Estimators\nFor simple linear regression, the OLS estimators are obtained by minimizing the sum of squared residuals:\nSSE = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (Y_i - \\beta_0 - \\beta_1 X_i)^2\nTaking partial derivatives with respect to \\beta_0 and \\beta_1 and setting them equal to zero yields the normal equations. Solving this system produces:\n\\hat{\\beta}_1 = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}(X_i - \\bar{X})(Y_i - \\bar{Y})}{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}(X_i - \\bar{X})^2} = \\frac{Cov(X,Y)}{Var(X)}\n\\hat{\\beta}_0 = \\bar{Y} - \\hat{\\beta}_1\\bar{X}\n\n\nProperties of OLS Estimators\nThe OLS procedure guarantees several important properties:\n\nZero sum of residuals: \\sum_{i=1}^{n} e_i = 0\nOrthogonality of residuals and predictors: \\sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i e_i = 0\nThe fitted regression line passes through the point (\\bar{X}, \\bar{Y})\nZero covariance between fitted values and residuals: \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\hat{Y}_i e_i = 0\n\n\n\nClassical Linear Model Assumptions\n\nCore Assumptions\nFor OLS estimators to possess desirable statistical properties, the following assumptions must hold:\n\n\nAssumption 1: Linearity in Parameters\nThe relationship between the dependent and independent variables is linear in the parameters: Y_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_{1i} + ... + \\beta_k X_{ki} + \\varepsilon_i\n\n\nAssumption 2: Strict Exogeneity\nThe error term has zero conditional expectation given all values of the independent variables: E[\\varepsilon_i | X] = 0\nThis assumption implies that the independent variables contain no information about the mean of the error term. It is stronger than contemporaneous exogeneity and rules out feedback from past errors to current regressors. This assumption is critical for unbiased estimation and is often violated in time series contexts with lagged dependent variables or in the presence of omitted variables.\nThis assumption is particularly important for our discussion of spurious correlations. Violations of the exogeneity assumption lead to endogeneity problems, which we will discuss later.\n\n\nAssumption 3: No Perfect Multicollinearity\nIn multiple regression, no independent variable can be expressed as a perfect linear combination of other independent variables.

The method’s mathematical elegance, combined with its optimal properties under the classical assumptions, explains its widespread application. However, practitioners must carefully verify assumptions and consider alternatives when these conditions are not met. Understanding both the theoretical foundations and practical limitations of OLS is essential for proper statistical inference and prediction.\n\n\nVisualizing OLS Through Different Regression Lines\nA simple but effective way to visualize the concept of “best fit” is to compare multiple lines and their resulting SSE values:\n\n# Load required libraries\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(gridExtra)\n\n# Create sample data\nset.seed(123)\nx &lt;- 1:20\ny &lt;- 2 + 3*x + rnorm(20, 0, 5)\ndata &lt;- data.frame(x = x, y = y)\n\n# Fit regression model\nmodel &lt;- lm(y ~ x, data = data)\ncoef &lt;- coefficients(model)\n\n# Define different lines: optimal and sub-optimal with clearer differences\nlines &lt;- data.frame(\n  label = c(\"Best Fit (OLS)\", \"Line A\", \"Line B\", \"Line C\"),\n  intercept = c(coef[1], coef[1] -

At its core, regression provides a systematic framework for understanding how changes in one or more independent variables influence a dependent variable.\nThe primary objectives of regression analysis include: - Quantifying relationships between variables - Making predictions based on observed patterns - Testing hypotheses about variable associations - Understanding the proportion of variation explained by predictors\n\n\nDeterministic versus Stochastic Models\nStatistical modeling encompasses two fundamental approaches:\nDeterministic models assume precise, invariant relationships between variables. Given specific inputs, these models yield identical outputs without variation. Consider the physics equation:\n\\text{Distance} = \\text{Speed} \\times \\text{Time}\nThis relationship exhibits no randomness; identical inputs always produce identical outputs.\nStochastic models, in contrast, acknowledge inherent variability in real-world phenomena. Regression analysis employs stochastic modeling through the fundamental equation:\nY = f(X) + \\epsilon\nWhere: - Y represents the outcome variable - f(X) captures the systematic relationship between predictors and outcome - \\epsilon represents random variation inherent in the data\nThis formulation recognizes that real-world relationships contain both systematic patterns and random variation.",

    "section": "9.29 The Ordinary Least Squares Method",
    "text": "9.29 The Ordinary Least Squares Method\n\nThe Fundamental Challenge\nGiven a dataset with observations (X_i, Y_i), we need a systematic method to determine the “best” values for \\hat{\\beta}_0 and \\hat{\\beta}_1. The challenge lies in defining what constitutes “best” and developing a practical method to find these values.\nConsider that for any given line through the data, each observation will have a prediction error or residual:\ne_i = Y_i - \\hat{Y}_i = Y_i - (\\hat{\\beta}_0 + \\hat{\\beta}_1X_i)\nThese residuals represent how far our predictions deviate from actual values. A good fitting line should make these residuals as small as possible overall.\n\n\nWhy Minimize the Sum of Squared Residuals?\nThe Ordinary Least Squares method determines optimal parameter estimates by minimizing the sum of squared residuals. This choice requires justification, as we could conceivably minimize other quantities. The rationale for squaring residuals includes:\nMathematical tractability: Squaring creates a smooth, differentiable function that yields closed-form solutions through calculus. The derivatives of squared terms lead to linear equations that can be solved analytically.\nEqual treatment of positive and negative errors: Simply summing raw residuals would allow positive and negative errors to cancel, potentially yielding a sum of zero even when predictions are poor. Squaring ensures all deviations contribute positively to the total error measure.\nPenalization of large errors: Squaring gives progressively greater weight to larger errors. An error of 4 units contributes 16 to the sum, while an error of 2 units contributes only 4. This property encourages finding a line that avoids extreme prediction errors.\nStatistical optimality: Under certain assumptions (including normally distributed errors), OLS estimators possess desirable statistical properties, including being the Best Linear Unbiased Estimators (BLUE) according to the Gauss-Markov theorem.\nConnection to variance: The sum of squared deviations directly relates to variance, a fundamental measure of spread in statistics. Minimizing squared residuals thus minimizes the variance of prediction errors.\n\n\nThe OLS Optimization Problem\nThe OLS method formally seeks values of \\hat{\\beta}_0 and \\hat{\\beta}_1 that minimize:\n\\text{SSE} = \\sum_{i=1}^n e_i^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^n (Y_i - \\hat{Y}_i)^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^n (Y_i - (\\hat{\\beta}_0 + \\hat{\\beta}_1X_i))^2\nThis optimization problem can be solved using calculus by: 1. Taking partial derivatives with respect to \\hat{\\beta}_0 and \\hat{\\beta}_1 2. Setting these derivatives equal to zero 3. Solving the resulting system of equations\n\n\nDerivation of OLS Estimators\nThe minimization yields closed-form solutions:\n\\hat{\\beta}_1 = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n(X_i - \\bar{X})(Y_i - \\bar{Y})}{\\sum_{i=1}^n(X_i - \\bar{X})^2} = \\frac{\\text{Cov}(X,Y)}{\\text{Var}(X)}\n\\hat{\\beta}_0 = \\bar{Y} - \\hat{\\beta}_1\\bar{X}\nThese formulas reveal that: - The slope estimate depends on the covariance between variables relative to the predictor’s variance - The intercept ensures the regression line passes through the point of means (\\bar{X}, \\bar{Y})\n\n\nProperties of OLS Estimators\nOLS estimators possess several desirable properties:\n\nUnbiasedness: Under appropriate conditions, E[\\hat{\\beta}_j] = \\beta_j\nEfficiency: OLS provides minimum variance among linear unbiased estimators\nConsistency: As sample size increases, estimates converge to true values\nThe regression line passes through the centroid: The point (\\bar{X}, \\bar{Y}) always lies on the fitted line\n\n\n\nExtension to Multiple Regression\nWhile this guide focuses on simple linear regression with one predictor, the OLS framework extends naturally to multiple regression with several predictors:\nY_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1X_{1i} + \\beta_2X_{2i} + ... + \\beta_kX_{ki} + \\epsilon_i\nThe same principle applies: we minimize the sum of squared residuals, though the mathematics involves matrix algebra rather than simple formulas. The fundamental logic—finding parameter values that minimize prediction errors—remains unchanged.",

    "text": "9.30 Understanding Variance Decomposition\n\nThe Baseline Model Concept\nBefore introducing predictors, consider the simplest possible model: predicting every observation using the overall mean \\bar{Y}. This baseline model represents our best prediction in the absence of additional information.\nThe baseline model’s predictions: \\hat{Y}_i^{\\text{baseline}} = \\bar{Y} \\text{ for all } i\nThis model serves as a reference point for evaluating improvement gained through incorporating predictors. The baseline model essentially asks: “If we knew nothing about the relationship between X and Y, what would be our best constant prediction?”\n\n\nComponents of Total Variation\nThe total variation in the outcome variable decomposes into three fundamental components:\n\nTotal Sum of Squares (SST)\nSST quantifies the total variation in the outcome variable relative to its mean:\n\\text{SST} = \\sum_{i=1}^n (Y_i - \\bar{Y})^2\nInterpretation: SST represents the total variance that requires explanation. It measures the prediction error when using only the mean as our model—essentially the variance explained by the baseline (zero) model. This is the starting point: the total amount of variation we hope to explain by introducing predictors.\n\n\nRegression Sum of Squares (SSR)\nSSR measures the variation explained by the regression model:\n\\text{SSR} = \\sum_{i=1}^n (\\hat{Y}_i - \\bar{Y})^2\nInterpretation: SSR quantifies the improvement in prediction achieved by incorporating the predictor variable. It represents the reduction in prediction error relative to the baseline model—the portion of total variation that our regression line successfully captures.\n\n\nError Sum of Squares (SSE)\nSSE captures the unexplained variation remaining after regression:\n\\text{SSE} = \\sum_{i=1}^n (Y_i - \\hat{Y}_i)^2\nInterpretation: SSE represents the residual variation that the model cannot explain, reflecting the inherent randomness and effects of omitted variables. This is the variation that remains even after using our best-fitting line.\n\n\n\nThe Fundamental Decomposition Identity\nThese components relate through the fundamental equation:\n\\text{SST} = \\text{SSR} + \\text{SSE}\nThis identity demonstrates that: - Total variation equals the sum of explained and unexplained components - The regression model partitions total variation into systematic and random parts - Model improvement can be assessed by comparing SSR to SST\n\n\nConceptual Framework for Variance Decomposition\n# Demonstration of Variance Decomposition\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n# Generate sample data\nset.seed(42)\nn &lt;- 50\nx &lt;- runif(n, 1, 10)\ny &lt;- 3 + 2*x + rnorm(n, 0, 2)\ndata &lt;- data.frame(x = x, y = y)\n\n# Fit model\nmodel &lt;- lm(y ~ x, data = data)\ny_mean &lt;- mean(y)\ny_pred &lt;- predict(model)\n\n# Calculate components\nSST &lt;- sum((y - y_mean)^2)\nSSR &lt;- sum((y_pred - y_mean)^2)\nSSE &lt;- sum((y - y_pred)^2)\n\n# Display decomposition\ncat(\"Variance Decomposition\\n\")\ncat(\"======================\\n\")\ncat(\"Total SS (SST):\", round(SST, 2), \n    \"- Total variation from mean\\n\")\ncat(\"Regression SS (SSR):\", round(SSR, 2), \n    \"- Variation explained by model\\n\")\ncat(\"Error SS (SSE):\", round(SSE, 2), \n    \"- Unexplained variation\\n\")\ncat(\"\\nVerification: SST = SSR + SSE\\n\")\ncat(round(SST, 2), \"=\", round(SSR, 2), \"+\", \n    round(SSE, 2), \"\\n\")",

    "text": "9.31 The Coefficient of Determination (R²)\n\nDefinition and Calculation\nThe coefficient of determination, denoted R², quantifies the proportion of total variation explained by the regression model:\nR^2 = \\frac{\\text{SSR}}{\\text{SST}} = \\frac{\\text{Explained Variation}}{\\text{Total Variation}}\nAlternatively expressed as:\nR^2 = 1 - \\frac{\\text{SSE}}{\\text{SST}} = 1 - \\frac{\\text{Unexplained Variation}}{\\text{Total Variation}}\nR² directly answers the question: “What proportion of the total variation in Y (relative to the baseline mean model) does our regression model explain?”\n\n\nInterpretation Guidelines\nR² values range from 0 to 1, with specific interpretations:\n\nR² = 0: The model explains no variation beyond the baseline mean model. The regression line provides no improvement over simply using \\bar{Y}.\nR² = 0.25: The model explains 25% of total variation. Three-quarters of the variation remains unexplained.\nR² = 0.75: The model explains 75% of total variation. This represents substantial explanatory power.\nR² = 1.00: The model explains all variation (perfect fit). All data points fall exactly on the regression line.\n\n\n\nContextual Considerations\nThe interpretation of R² requires careful consideration of context:\nField-specific standards: Acceptable R² values vary dramatically across disciplines - Physical sciences often expect R² &gt; 0.90 due to controlled conditions - Social sciences may consider R² = 0.30 meaningful given human complexity - Biological systems typically show intermediate values due to natural variation\nSample size effects: Small samples can artificially inflate R², leading to overly optimistic assessments of model fit.\nModel complexity: In multiple regression, additional predictors mechanically increase R², even if they lack true explanatory power.\nPractical significance: Statistical fit should align with substantive importance. A model with R² = 0.95 may be less useful than one with R² = 0.60 if the latter addresses more relevant questions.\n\n\nAdjusted R² for Multiple Regression\nWhen extending to multiple regression, adjusted R² accounts for the number of predictors:\nR^2_{\\text{adj}} = 1 - \\frac{\\text{SSE}/(n-p)}{\\text{SST}/(n-1)}\nWhere: - n = sample size - p = number of parameters (including intercept)\nAdjusted R² penalizes model complexity, providing a more conservative measure when comparing models with different numbers of predictors.\n\n\nMeasures of Fit\n\nR-squared (R^2): R^2 = \\frac{SSR}{SST} = 1 - \\frac{SSE}{SST}\nRoot Mean Square Error (RMSE): RMSE = \\sqrt{\\frac{SSE}{n}}\nMean Absolute Error (MAE): MAE = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n |Y_i - \\hat{Y}_i|",

    "text": "9.33 Summary and Key Insights\n\nCore Concepts Review\nRegression analysis models relationships between variables using stochastic frameworks that acknowledge inherent variation. The simple linear regression model expresses this relationship as Y_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1X_i + \\epsilon_i.\nOrdinary Least Squares provides optimal parameter estimates by minimizing the sum of squared residuals. This choice of minimizing squared errors stems from mathematical tractability, equal treatment of positive and negative errors, appropriate penalization of large errors, and desirable statistical properties.\nVariance decomposition partitions total variation into: - Total variation from the baseline mean model (SST) - Variation explained by the regression model (SSR)\n- Unexplained residual variation (SSE)\nThe fundamental identity SST = SSR + SSE shows how regression improves upon the baseline model.\nR² quantifies model performance as the proportion of total variation explained, providing a standardized measure of how much better the regression model performs compared to simply using the mean.\n\n\nCritical Considerations\nThe baseline model (predicting with the mean) serves as the fundamental reference point. All regression improvement is measured relative to this simple model. SST represents the total variance requiring explanation when we start with no predictors.\nParameter estimates (\\hat{\\beta}_0, \\hat{\\beta}_1) represent sample-based approximations of unknown population values (\\beta_0, \\beta_1). The distinction between population parameters and sample estimates remains crucial for proper inference.\nModel assessment requires considering both statistical fit (R²) and practical significance. A model with modest R² may still provide valuable insights, while high R² does not guarantee causation or practical utility.\n\n\nExtensions and Applications\nWhile this guide focuses on simple linear regression, the framework extends naturally to: - Multiple regression with several predictors - Polynomial regression for nonlinear relationships - Interaction terms to capture conditional effects - Categorical predictors through appropriate coding\nThe fundamental principles—minimizing prediction errors, decomposing variation, and assessing model fit—remain consistent across these extensions. The mathematical complexity increases, but the conceptual foundation established here continues to apply.",

The correlation between chocolate consumption and Nobel prizes appears significant (p &lt; 0.05) when analyzed directly, even though it’s explained by a third variable - national wealth (GDP per capita).\nWealthier countries typically consume more chocolate and simultaneously invest more in education and research, leading to more Nobel prizes. Without controlling for this confounding factor, we would mistakenly conclude a direct relationship between chocolate and Nobel prizes.\nThe multiple testing demonstration further illustrates why spurious correlations appear so frequently in research. When conducting 100 statistical tests on completely random data, we expect approximately 5 “significant” results at α = 0.05 purely by chance. In real research settings where hundreds of variables might be analyzed, the probability of finding false positive correlations increases dramatically.\nThis example underscores three critical points:\n\nSmall sample sizes (16 countries) are particularly vulnerable to chance correlations\nConfounding variables can create strong apparent associations between unrelated factors\nMultiple testing without appropriate corrections virtually guarantees finding “significant” but meaningless patterns\n\nSuch findings explain why replication is essential in research and why most initial “discoveries” fail to hold up in subsequent studies.\n\n\nConfounding Variables (Hidden Third Factors)\nConfounding occurs when an external variable influences both the predictor and outcome variables, creating an apparent relationship that may disappear when the confounder is accounted for.\n\n# Create sample data\nn &lt;- 200\nability &lt;- rnorm(n, 100, 15)                       # Natural ability \neducation &lt;- 10 + 0.05 * ability + rnorm(n, 0, 2)  # Education affected by ability\nincome &lt;- 10000 + 2000 * education + 100 * ability + rnorm(n, 0, 5000)  # Income affected by both\n\nomitted_var_data &lt;- data.frame(\n  ability = ability,\n  education = education,\n  income = income\n)\n\n# Model without accounting for ability\nmodel_naive &lt;- lm(income ~ education, data = omitted_var_data)\n\n# Model accounting for ability\nmodel_full &lt;- lm(income ~ education + ability, data = omitted_var_data)\n\n# Show results\nsummary(model_naive)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = income ~ education, data = omitted_var_data)\n\nResiduals:\n     Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max \n-14422.9  -3362.1    142.7   3647.7  14229.6 \n\nCoefficients:\n            Estimate Std.

However, once temperature is included in the model, the coefficient for ice cream sales decreases substantially and becomes statistically insignificant. This demonstrates how failing to account for confounding variables can lead to spurious correlations.\n\n\n\nReverse Causality\nReverse causality occurs when the assumed direction of causation is incorrect.

This violates the exogeneity assumption of OLS regression and leads to biased estimates. There are several sources of endogeneity:\n\nOmitted Variable Bias\nAs shown in the education-income example, when important variables are omitted from the model, their effects are absorbed into the error term, which becomes correlated with included variables.\n\n\nMeasurement Error\nWhen variables are measured with error, the observed values differ from true values, creating correlation between the error term and the predictors.\n\n\nSimultaneity (Bidirectional Causality)\nWhen the dependent variable also affects the independent variable, creating a feedback loop. Let’s demonstrate this:\n\n# Create sample data with mutual influence\nn &lt;- 100\n\n# Initialize variables\neconomic_growth &lt;- rnorm(n, 2, 1)\nemployment_rate &lt;- rnorm(n, 60, 5)\n\n# Create mutual influence through iterations\nfor(i in 1:3) {\n  economic_growth &lt;- 2 + 0.05 * employment_rate + rnorm(n, 0, 0.5)\n  employment_rate &lt;- 50 + 5 * economic_growth + rnorm(n, 0, 2)\n}\n\nsimultaneity_data &lt;- data.frame(\n  growth = economic_growth,\n  employment = employment_rate\n)\n\n# Model estimating effect of growth on employment\nmodel_growth_on_emp &lt;- lm(employment ~ growth, data = simultaneity_data)\n\n# Model estimating effect of employment on growth\nmodel_emp_on_growth &lt;- lm(growth ~ employment, data = simultaneity_data)\n\n# Show results\nsummary(model_growth_on_emp)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = employment ~ growth, data = simultaneity_data)\n\nResiduals:\n   Min     1Q Median     3Q    Max \n-3.603 -1.500 -0.099  1.387  5.673 \n\nCoefficients:\n            Estimate Std.

The collider bias example demonstrates a form of selection bias.\nThe consequences of endogeneity include: - Biased coefficient estimates - Incorrect standard errors - Invalid hypothesis tests - Misleading causal interpretations\nAddressing endogeneity requires specialized methods such as instrumental variables, system estimation, panel data methods, or experimental designs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnderstanding Endogeneity in Regression\n\n\n\nEndogeneity is a critical concept in statistical analysis that occurs when an explanatory variable in a regression model is correlated with the error term. This creates challenges for accurately understanding cause-and-effect relationships in research. Let’s examine the three main types of endogeneity and how they affect research outcomes.\n\nOmitted Variable Bias (OVB)\nOmitted Variable Bias occurs when an important variable that affects both the dependent and independent variables is left out of the analysis. This omission leads to incorrect conclusions about the relationship between the variables we’re studying.\nConsider a study examining the relationship between education and income:\nExample: Education and Income The observed relationship shows that more education correlates with higher income. However, an individual’s inherent abilities affect both their educational attainment and their earning potential. Without accounting for ability, we may overestimate education’s direct effect on income.\nThe statistical representation shows why this matters:\ny_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1x_i + \\beta_2z_i + \\epsilon_i (Complete model)\ny_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1x_i + u_i (Incomplete model)\nWhen we omit an important variable, our estimates of the remaining relationships become biased and unreliable.\n\n\nSimultaneity\nSimultaneity occurs when two variables simultaneously influence each other, making it difficult to determine the direction of causation. This creates a feedback loop that complicates statistical analysis.\nCommon Examples of Simultaneity:\nAcademic Performance and Study Habits represent a clear case of simultaneity. Academic performance influences how much time students dedicate to studying, while study time affects academic performance. This two-way relationship makes it challenging to measure the isolated effect of either variable.\nMarket Dynamics provide another example. Prices influence demand, while demand influences prices. This concurrent relationship requires special analytical approaches to understand the true relationships.\n\n\nMeasurement Error\nMeasurement error occurs when we cannot accurately measure our variables of interest. This imprecision can significantly impact our analysis and conclusions.\nCommon Sources of Measurement Error:\nSelf-Reported Data presents a significant challenge. When participants report their own behaviors or characteristics, such as study time, the reported values often differ from actual values. This discrepancy affects our ability to measure true relationships.\nTechnical Limitations also contribute to measurement error through imprecise measuring tools, inconsistent measurement conditions, and recording or data entry errors.\n\n\nAddressing Endogeneity in Research\n\nIdentification Strategies\n\n# Example of controlling for omitted variables\nmodel_simple &lt;- lm(income ~ education, data = df)\nmodel_full &lt;- lm(income ~ education + ability + experience + region, data = df)\n\n# Compare coefficients\nsummary(model_simple)\nsummary(model_full)\n\n\nInclude Additional Variables: Collect data on potentially important omitted variables and include relevant control variables in your analysis. For example, including measures of ability when studying education’s effect on income.\nUse Panel Data: Collect data across multiple time periods to control for unobserved fixed characteristics and analyze changes over time.\nInstrumental Variables: Find variables that affect your independent variable but not your dependent variable to isolate the relationship of interest.\n\n\n\nImproving Measurement\n\nMultiple Measurements: Take several measurements of key variables, use averaging to reduce random error, and compare different measurement methods.\nBetter Data Collection: Use validated measurement instruments, implement quality control procedures, and document potential sources of error.\n\n\n\n\nBest Practices for Researchers\nResearch Design fundamentally shapes your ability to address endogeneity. Plan for potential endogeneity issues before collecting data, include measures for potentially important control variables, and consider using multiple measurement approaches.\nAnalysis should include testing for endogeneity when possible, using appropriate statistical methods for your specific situation, and documenting assumptions and limitations.\nReporting must clearly describe potential endogeneity concerns, explain how you addressed these issues, and discuss implications for your conclusions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFormal Derivation of OLS Estimators: A Complete Mathematical Treatment\n\n\n\n\nObjective and Setup\nWe seek to find the values of \\hat{\\beta}_0 and \\hat{\\beta}_1 that minimize the sum of squared residuals:\nSSE = \\sum_{i=1}^n e_i^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - (\\hat{\\beta}_0 + \\hat{\\beta}_1x_i))^2\nThis is an unconstrained optimization problem where we treat SSE as a function of two variables: SSE(\\hat{\\beta}_0, \\hat{\\beta}_1).\n\n\nMathematical Prerequisites\nChain Rule for Composite Functions: For f(g(x)), the derivative is: \\frac{d}{dx}[f(g(x))] = f'(g(x)) \\cdot g'(x)\nIn our context:\n\nOuter function: f(u) = u^2 with derivative f'(u) = 2u\nInner function: u = y_i - (\\hat{\\beta}_0 + \\hat{\\beta}_1x_i)\n\nFirst-Order Conditions: At a minimum, both partial derivatives equal zero: \\frac{\\partial SSE}{\\partial \\hat{\\beta}_0} = 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{\\partial SSE}{\\partial \\hat{\\beta}_1} = 0\n\n\nDerivation of \\hat{\\beta}_0\nStep 1: Take the partial derivative with respect to \\hat{\\beta}_0:\n\\frac{\\partial SSE}{\\partial \\hat{\\beta}_0} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\hat{\\beta}_0} \\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \\hat{\\beta}_0 - \\hat{\\beta}_1x_i)^2\nStep 2: Apply the chain rule to each term: = \\sum_{i=1}^n 2(y_i - \\hat{\\beta}_0 - \\hat{\\beta}_1x_i) \\cdot \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\hat{\\beta}_0}(y_i - \\hat{\\beta}_0 - \\hat{\\beta}_1x_i)\n= \\sum_{i=1}^n 2(y_i - \\hat{\\beta}_0 - \\hat{\\beta}_1x_i) \\cdot (-1)\n= -2\\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \\hat{\\beta}_0 - \\hat{\\beta}_1x_i)\nStep 3: Set equal to zero and solve: -2\\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \\hat{\\beta}_0 - \\hat{\\beta}_1x_i) = 0\nDividing by -2 and expanding: \\sum_{i=1}^n y_i - n\\hat{\\beta}_0 - \\hat{\\beta}_1\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i = 0\nStep 4: Isolate \\hat{\\beta}_0: n\\hat{\\beta}_0 = \\sum_{i=1}^n y_i - \\hat{\\beta}_1\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i\n\\boxed{\\hat{\\beta}_0 = \\bar{y} - \\hat{\\beta}_1\\bar{x}}\nInterpretation: The intercept adjusts to ensure the regression line passes through the point of means (\\bar{x}, \\bar{y}).\n\n\nDerivation of \\hat{\\beta}_1\nStep 1: Take the partial derivative with respect to \\hat{\\beta}_1:\n\\frac{\\partial SSE}{\\partial \\hat{\\beta}_1} = \\sum_{i=1}^n 2(y_i - \\hat{\\beta}_0 - \\hat{\\beta}_1x_i) \\cdot (-x_i)\n= -2\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i(y_i - \\hat{\\beta}_0 - \\hat{\\beta}_1x_i)\nStep 2: Substitute the expression for \\hat{\\beta}_0: = -2\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i(y_i - (\\bar{y} - \\hat{\\beta}_1\\bar{x}) - \\hat{\\beta}_1x_i)\n= -2\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i((y_i - \\bar{y}) - \\hat{\\beta}_1(x_i - \\bar{x}))\nStep 3: Set equal to zero and expand: \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i(y_i - \\bar{y}) - \\hat{\\beta}_1\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i(x_i - \\bar{x}) = 0\nStep 4: Use the algebraic identity \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i(y_i - \\bar{y}) = \\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \\bar{x})(y_i - \\bar{y}):\nThis identity holds because: \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i(y_i - \\bar{y}) = \\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \\bar{x} + \\bar{x})(y_i - \\bar{y}) = \\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \\bar{x})(y_i - \\bar{y}) + \\bar{x}\\sum_{i=1}^n(y_i - \\bar{y}) = \\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \\bar{x})(y_i - \\bar{y}) + 0\nSimilarly, \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i(x_i - \\bar{x}) = \\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \\bar{x})^2.\nStep 5: Solve for \\hat{\\beta}_1: \\hat{\\beta}_1\\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \\bar{x})^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \\bar{x})(y_i - \\bar{y})\n\\boxed{\\hat{\\beta}_1 = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \\bar{x})(y_i - \\bar{y})}{\\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \\bar{x})^2} = \\frac{\\text{Cov}(X,Y)}{\\text{Var}(X)}}\n\n\nVerification of Minimum (Second-Order Conditions)\nTo confirm we have found a minimum (not a maximum or saddle point), we examine the Hessian matrix of second partial derivatives:\nSecond partial derivatives:\n\\frac{\\partial^2 SSE}{\\partial \\hat{\\beta}_0^2} = 2n &gt; 0\n\\frac{\\partial^2 SSE}{\\partial \\hat{\\beta}_1^2} = 2\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2 &gt; 0\n\\frac{\\partial^2 SSE}{\\partial \\hat{\\beta}_0 \\partial \\hat{\\beta}_1} = 2\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i\nHessian matrix: \\mathbf{H} = 2\\begin{bmatrix} n & \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i \\\\ \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i & \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2 \\end{bmatrix}\nPositive definiteness check:\n\nFirst leading principal minor: 2n &gt;

    "text": "9.40 Theoretical Derivation\nConsider a data generating process (DGP) where the true relationship between x and y is:\n y = 2x + e \nHowever, there is an endogeneity problem because the error term e is correlated with x in the following way:\n e = 1x + u \nwhere u is an independent error term.\nIf we estimate the simple linear model y = \\hat{\\beta_0} + \\hat{\\beta_1}x + \\varepsilon using OLS, the OLS estimator of \\hat{\\beta_1} will be biased due to the endogeneity issue.\nTo understand the bias, let’s derive the expected value of the OLS estimator \\hat{\\beta}_1:\n\\begin{align*}\nE[\\hat{\\beta}_1] &= E[(X'X)^{-1}X'y] \\\\\n                 &= E[(X'X)^{-1}X'(2x + 1x + u)] \\\\\n                 &= E[(X'X)^{-1}X'(3x + u)] \\\\\n                 &= 3 + E[(X'X)^{-1}X'u]\n\\end{align*}\nIf the error term u is uncorrelated with x, then E[(X'X)^{-1}X'u] = 0, and the OLS estimator would be unbiased: E[\\hat{\\beta}_1] = 3. However, in this case, the original error term e is correlated with x, so u is also likely to be correlated with x.\nAssuming E[(X'X)^{-1}X'u] \\neq 0, the OLS estimator will be biased:\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{Bias}(\\hat{\\beta}_1) &= E[\\hat{\\beta}_1] - \\beta_{1,\\text{true}} \\\\\n                           &= 3 + E[(X'X)^{-1}X'u] - 2 \\\\\n                           &= 1 + E[(X'X)^{-1}X'u]\n\\end{align*}\nThe direction and magnitude of the bias will depend on the correlation between x and u. If x and u are positively correlated, the bias will be positive, and the OLS estimator will overestimate the true coefficient. Conversely, if x and u are negatively correlated, the bias will be negative, and the OLS estimator will underestimate the true coefficient.",

    "text": "9.51 Simple OLS Regression\n\nThe Problem of Modeling Relationships\nWhen we observe a relationship between two variables, we want to find a mathematical model that:\n\nDescribes the relationship\nAllows us to make predictions\nQuantifies the strength of the relationship\n\nThe simplest model is a straight line: Y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X + \\epsilon\nWhere:\n\nY is the outcome variable (performance)\nX is the predictor variable (anxiety)\n\\beta_0 is the intercept (performance when anxiety = 0)\n\\beta_1 is the slope (change in performance per unit change in anxiety)\n\\epsilon is the error term (unexplained variation)\n\n\n\nThe Idea of Sum of Squared Errors (SSE)\n\nWhy Do We Need a Criterion?\nImagine trying to draw a line through our data points. There are infinitely many lines we could draw! Some would go through the middle of the points, others might be too high or too low, too steep or too flat. We need a systematic way to determine which line is “best.”\n\n# Visualize multiple possible lines\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n# Create different possible lines\nggplot(data.frame(anxiety, performance), aes(x = anxiety, y = performance)) +\n  geom_point(size = 4, color = \"darkblue\") +\n  # Bad line 1: Too steep\n  geom_abline(intercept = 100, slope = -5, color = \"gray\", linetype = \"dashed\", alpha = 0.5) +\n  # Bad line 2: Too flat\n  geom_abline(intercept = 78, slope = -0.5, color = \"gray\", linetype = \"dashed\", alpha = 0.5) +\n  # Bad line 3: Wrong direction\n  geom_abline(intercept = 65, slope = 2, color = \"gray\", linetype = \"dashed\", alpha = 0.5) +\n  # Good line (we'll calculate this properly)\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE, color = \"red\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Which Line Best Fits Our Data?\",\n    subtitle = \"Gray dashed lines show poor fits, red line shows the optimal fit\",\n    x = \"Test Anxiety Score\",\n    y = \"Exam Performance (%)\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat Are Errors (Residuals)?\nFor any line we draw, each data point will have an error or residual - the vertical distance from the point to the line. This represents how “wrong” our prediction is for that point.\n\nPositive error: The actual value is above the predicted value (we underestimated)\nNegative error: The actual value is below the predicted value (we overestimated)\n\n\n# Visualize errors for the regression line\nmodel &lt;- lm(performance ~ anxiety)\npredicted &lt;- predict(model)\n\nggplot(data.frame(anxiety, performance, predicted), aes(x = anxiety, y = performance)) +\n  geom_point(size = 4, color = \"darkblue\") +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE, color = \"red\") +\n  geom_segment(aes(xend = anxiety, yend = predicted), \n               color = \"gray50\", linetype = \"dashed\", alpha = 0.7) +\n  # Add labels for a few errors\n  geom_text(aes(x = 3.2, y = 86, label = \"Error = +4.9\"), size = 3, color = \"gray40\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x = 7.0, y = 69, label = \"Error = -1.4\"), size = 3, color = \"gray40\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Visualizing Errors (Residuals) in Regression\",\n    subtitle = \"Dashed lines show the vertical distance from each point to the regression line\",\n    x = \"Test Anxiety Score\",\n    y = \"Exam Performance (%)\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy Square the Errors?\nSimply adding up the errors won’t work because positive and negative errors cancel out. We could use absolute values, but squaring has several advantages:\n\nMathematical convenience: Squared functions are differentiable, making it easier to find the minimum using calculus\nPenalizes large errors more: A few large errors are worse than many small errors\n\nError of 4: squared = 16\nTwo errors of 2: squared = 4 + 4 = 8\nFour errors of 1: squared = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4\n\nCreates a smooth, bowl-shaped function: This guarantees a unique minimum\n\n\n\nThe SSE Formula\nThe Sum of Squared Errors is: SSE = \\sum_{i=1}^{n}(Y_i - \\hat{Y_i})^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^{n}(Y_i - (\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_i))^2\n\n\\min_{\\beta}\\ \\sum_{i=1}^n\\bigl(Y_i-\\hat{Y}_i(\\beta)\\bigr)^2,\n\\quad\\text{where } \\hat{Y}_i(\\beta)=\\beta_0+\\beta_1X_i.\n\nThis formula:\n\nTakes each actual value (Y_i)\nSubtracts the predicted value (\\hat{Y}_i(\\beta)=\\beta_0+\\beta_1X_i)\nSquares the difference\nAdds them all up\n\n\n\nFinding the Best Line\nThe “best” line is the one that minimizes SSE. Using calculus (taking derivatives with respect to \\beta_0 and \\beta_1 and setting them to zero), we get the OLS formulas.\n\n\n\nOLS Estimators\nThe Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) method finds the values of \\beta_0 and \\beta_1 that minimize SSE:\nSlope estimator: \\hat{\\beta_1} = \\frac{s_{XY}}{s^2_X} = \\frac{\\sum(X_i - \\bar{X})(Y_i - \\bar{Y})}{\\sum(X_i - \\bar{X})^2}\nIntercept estimator: \\hat{\\beta_0} = \\bar{Y} - \\hat{\\beta_1}\\bar{X}\n\n\nCalculating the OLS Parameters\nUsing our calculated values:\n\ns_{XY} = -8.6\ns^2_X = 3.5079\n\\bar{X} = 5.175\n\\bar{Y} = 77\n\nStep 1: Calculate the slope \\hat{\\beta_1} = \\frac{s_{XY}}{s^2_X} = \\frac{-8.6}{3.5079} = -2.451\nStep 2: Calculate the intercept \\hat{\\beta_0} = \\bar{Y} - \\hat{\\beta_1}\\bar{X} = 77 - (-2.451 \\times 5.175) = 77 + 12.684 = 89.684\n\n# Verify with R\nmodel &lt;- lm(performance ~ anxiety)\ncoef(model)\n\n(Intercept)     anxiety \n  89.687233   -2.451639 \n\n\nOur regression equation is: \\hat{Y} = 89.684 - 2.451X\nThis means:\n\nWhen anxiety = 0, predicted performance = 89.68%\nFor each 1-point increase in anxiety, performance decreases by 2.45%",

    "text": "9.53 Model Evaluation\n\nVariance Decomposition\nThe total variation in Y can be decomposed into two parts:\nSST = SSE + SSR\nWhere:\n\nSST (Total Sum of Squares): Total variation in Y\nSSE (Sum of Squared Errors): Unexplained variation\n\nSSR (Sum of Squares Regression): Explained variation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nImagine you’re trying to understand why people have different salaries at a company. Some people make $40,000, others make $80,000, and some make $120,000. There’s variation in salaries - they’re not all the same.\n\nThe Total Variation (SST)\nThis is simply asking: “How spread out are all the salaries from the average salary?”\nIf the average salary is $70,000, then SST measures how far each person’s salary differs from $70,000, squares those differences (to make them all positive), and adds them up. It’s the total amount of variation we’re trying to understand.\n\n\nThe Explained Variation (SSR)\nNow suppose we build a model that predicts salary based on years of experience. Our model might say: - 2 years experience → predicts $50,000 - 5 years experience → predicts $70,000\n- 10 years experience → predicts $100,000\nSSR measures how much these predictions vary from the average. It’s the variation that our model successfully “explains” through the relationship with experience. It’s like saying “this much of the salary differences between people is because they have different amounts of experience.”\n\n\nThe Unexplained Variation (SSE)\nThis is what’s left over - the part our model can’t explain.\nMaybe two people both have 5 years of experience, but one makes $65,000 and another makes $75,000. Our model predicted $70,000 for both. These differences from our predictions (the errors) represent variation due to other factors we haven’t captured - maybe education, performance, negotiation skills, or just random luck.\n\n\n9.54 The Key Insight\nThe beautiful thing is that these three always relate as: Total Variation = Explained Variation + Unexplained Variation\nIt’s like having a pie chart of “why salaries differ”: - One slice is “differences explained by experience” (SSR) - The other slice is “differences due to other stuff” (SSE) - Together they make the whole pie (SST)\n\n\n9.55 Why This Matters\nThis decomposition lets us calculate R-squared (R²), which is simply: R^2 = \\frac{SSR}{SST} = \\frac{\\text{Explained Variation}}{\\text{Total Variation}}\nIf R² = 0.70, it means our model explains 70% of why the Y values differ from each other. The remaining 30% is due to factors we haven’t captured or random noise.\nThink of it like solving a mystery: SST is the total mystery to solve, SSR is how much of the mystery you’ve solved, and SSE is what remains unsolved!\n\n\n\nLet’s calculate each:\nStep 1: Calculate predicted values\nUsing \\hat{Y} = 89.684 - 2.451X:\n\n\n\ni\nX_i\nY_i\n\\hat{Y}_i = 89.684 - 2.451X_i\n\n\n\n\n1\n2.5\n80\n89.684 - 2.451(2.5) = 83.556\n\n\n2\n3.2\n85\n89.684 - 2.451(3.2) = 81.841\n\n\n3\n4.1\n78\n89.684 - 2.451(4.1) = 79.635\n\n\n4\n4.8\n82\n89.684 - 2.451(4.8) = 77.919\n\n\n5\n5.6\n77\n89.684 - 2.451(5.6) = 75.968\n\n\n6\n6.3\n74\n89.684 - 2.451(6.3) = 74.253\n\n\n7\n7.0\n68\n89.684 - 2.451(7.0) = 72.527\n\n\n8\n7.9\n72\n89.684 - 2.451(7.9) = 70.321\n\n\n\nStep 2: Calculate sum of squares\nSST (Total variation): SST = \\sum(Y_i - \\bar{Y})^2\nFrom our earlier variance calculation: SST = (n-1) \\times s^2_Y = 7 \\times 30.5714 = 214\nSSE (Unexplained variation): SSE = \\sum(Y_i - \\hat{Y}_i)^2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ni\nY_i\n\\hat{Y}_i\nY_i - \\hat{Y}_i\n(Y_i - \\hat{Y}_i)^2\n\n\n\n\n1\n80\n83.556\n-3.556\n12.645\n\n\n2\n85\n81.841\n3.159\n9.979\n\n\n3\n78\n79.635\n-1.635\n2.673\n\n\n4\n82\n77.919\n4.081\n16.655\n\n\n5\n77\n75.968\n1.032\n1.065\n\n\n6\n74\n74.253\n-0.253\n0.064\n\n\n7\n68\n72.527\n-4.527\n20.494\n\n\n8\n72\n70.321\n1.679\n2.819\n\n\nSum\n\n\n\n66.394\n\n\n\nSSR (Explained variation): SSR = SST - SSE = 214 - 66.394 = 147.606\n\n# Verify calculations\nanova_table &lt;- anova(model)\ncat(\"SSR (Regression):\", anova_table$`Sum Sq`[1], \"\\n\")\n\nSSR (Regression): 147.5887 \n\ncat(\"SSE (Residual):\", anova_table$`Sum Sq`[2], \"\\n\")\n\nSSE (Residual): 66.41132 \n\ncat(\"SST (Total):\", sum(anova_table$`Sum Sq`), \"\\n\")\n\nSST (Total): 214 \n\n\n\n\nR-squared (Coefficient of Determination)\nR-squared tells us what proportion of the total variation in Y is explained by our model:\nR^2 = \\frac{SSR}{SST} = \\frac{147.606}{214} = 0.690\nThis means our model explains 69.0% of the variation in exam performance.\nAlternative formula using correlation: R^2 = r^2 = (-0.831)^2 = 0.691\n\n# Verify R-squared\ncat(\"R-squared:\", summary(model)$r.squared, \"\\n\")\n\nR-squared: 0.6896667 \n\ncat(\"Correlation squared:\", cor(anxiety, performance)^2, \"\\n\")\n\nCorrelation squared: 0.6896667",

    "text": "9.57 Confidence Intervals and Statistical Significance\n\nStandard Error of the Regression\nFirst, we need the standard error of the residuals:\ns_e = \\sqrt{\\frac{SSE}{n-2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{66.394}{6}} = \\sqrt{11.066} = 3.327\n\n\nStandard Error of the Slope\nThe standard error of \\hat{\\beta_1} is:\nSE(\\hat{\\beta_1}) = \\frac{s_e}{\\sqrt{\\sum(X_i - \\bar{X})^2}} = \\frac{3.327}{\\sqrt{24.555}} = \\frac{3.327}{4.955} = 0.671\n\n\n95% Confidence Interval for the Slope\nIn plain English: A confidence interval gives us a range of plausible values for our true slope. If we repeated this study many times, 95% of the intervals we calculate would contain the true slope value.\nThe formula uses a critical value (approximately 2.45 for 6 degrees of freedom):\nCI = \\hat{\\beta_1} \\pm (critical\\_value \\times SE(\\hat{\\beta_1})) CI = -2.451 \\pm (2.45 \\times 0.671) CI = -2.451 \\pm 1.644 CI = [-4.095, -0.807]\nInterpretation: We are 95% confident that the true change in performance per unit change in anxiety is between -4.10% and -0.81%.\n\n\nStatistical Significance\nTo test if the relationship is statistically significant (i.e., not due to chance), we calculate a t-statistic:\nt = \\frac{\\hat{\\beta_1}}{SE(\\hat{\\beta_1})} = \\frac{-2.451}{0.671} = -3.653\nIn plain English: This t-value tells us how many standard errors our slope is away from zero. An absolute value of 3.65 is quite large (typically, values beyond ±2.45 are considered significant for our sample size), providing strong evidence of a real negative relationship between anxiety and performance.\n\n# Verify calculations with R\nsummary(model)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = performance ~ anxiety)\n\nResiduals:\n   Min     1Q Median     3Q    Max \n-4.526 -2.116  0.400  2.050  4.081 \n\nCoefficients:\n            Estimate Std.

    "text": "9.58 Summary and Interpretation\n\nWhat We’ve Learned\n\nThere is a negative relationship between test anxiety and exam performance (r = -0.831)\nThe relationship is moderately strong - anxiety explains 69.0% of the variation in performance\nThe effect is substantial - each 1-point increase in anxiety is associated with about a 2.5% decrease in performance\nThe relationship is statistically significant - very unlikely to be due to chance\n\n\n\nPractical Implications\nOur analysis suggests that high test anxiety impairs performance, possibly through:\n\nCognitive interference (worrying thoughts compete for working memory)\nPhysical symptoms (sweating, rapid heartbeat) that distract from the task\nNegative self-talk reducing confidence and motivation\nTest-taking behaviors (rushing, second-guessing answers)\n\n\n\nRecommendations Based on Findings\nGiven the strong negative relationship, interventions might include:\n\nTeaching anxiety management techniques (deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation)\nCognitive restructuring to address catastrophic thinking\nStudy skills training to increase preparation confidence\nPractice tests to reduce fear of the unknown\n\n\n\nLimitations of Our Analysis\n\nSmall sample size (n = 8) limits generalizability\nLinear assumption - the relationship might be curved (optimal anxiety might exist)\nOther variables not considered (preparation time, ability, sleep, etc.)\nCausation vs. correlation - we cannot prove anxiety causes poor performance\nSelf-reported anxiety - subjective measures may not reflect physiological arousal\n\n\n\nComplete R Code\n\n# Complete analysis code\nanxiety &lt;- c(2.5, 3.2, 4.1, 4.8, 5.6, 6.3, 7.0, 7.9)\nperformance &lt;- c(80, 85, 78, 82, 77, 74, 68, 72)\n\n# Descriptive statistics\nmean(anxiety); sd(anxiety)\nmean(performance); sd(performance)\n\n# Correlation\ncor(anxiety, performance)\n\n# Regression\nmodel &lt;- lm(performance ~ anxiety)\nsummary(model)\nconfint(model)\n\n# Visualization\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nggplot(data.frame(anxiety, performance), aes(x = anxiety, y = performance)) +\n  geom_point(size = 4) +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = TRUE) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n# Diagnostics\nplot(model)\n\n# ANOVA table\nanova(model)",

It indicates whether a matrix is invertible.\nFor a 2 \\times 2 matrix:\n\n\\det\\begin{bmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d \\end{bmatrix} = ad - bc\n\nExample:\n\n\\det\\begin{bmatrix} 3 & 8 \\\\ 4 & 6 \\end{bmatrix} = 3(6) - 8(4) = 18 - 32 = -14\n\nFor a 3 \\times 3 matrix (cofactor expansion along first row):\n\n\\det\\begin{bmatrix} a & b & c \\\\ d & e & f \\\\ g & h & i \\end{bmatrix} = a\\begin{vmatrix} e & f \\\\ h & i \\end{vmatrix} - b\\begin{vmatrix} d & f \\\\ g & i \\end{vmatrix} + c\\begin{vmatrix} d & e \\\\ g & h \\end{vmatrix}\n\nProperties:\n\nIf \\det(\\mathbf{A}) = 0, the matrix is singular (not invertible)\nIf \\det(\\mathbf{A}) \\neq 0, the matrix is non-singular (invertible)\n\\det(\\mathbf{AB}) = \\det(\\mathbf{A})\\det(\\mathbf{B})\n\\det(\\mathbf{A}^T) = \\det(\\mathbf{A})\n\n\n\nA.1.5 Matrix Inverse\nThe inverse of matrix \\mathbf{A}, denoted \\mathbf{A}^{-1}, satisfies:\n\n\\mathbf{AA}^{-1} = \\mathbf{A}^{-1}\\mathbf{A} = \\mathbf{I}\n\nFor a 2 \\times 2 matrix:\n\n\\begin{bmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d \\end{bmatrix}^{-1} = \\frac{1}{ad-bc}\\begin{bmatrix} d & -b \\\\ -c & a \\end{bmatrix}\n\nFor larger matrices, the inverse can be computed as:\n\n\\mathbf{A}^{-1} = \\frac{1}{\\det(\\mathbf{A})}\\text{adj}(\\mathbf{A})\n\nwhere \\text{adj}(\\mathbf{A}) is the adjugate (transpose of the cofactor matrix).\nProperties:\n\n(A^{-1})^{-1} = A\n(AB)^{-1} = B^{-1}A^{-1}\n(A^T)^{-1} = (A^{-1})^T\n\n\n\nA.1.6 Matrix Rank\nThe rank of a matrix is the maximum number of linearly independent rows (or columns). A matrix \\mathbf{X} of size n \\times p has:\n\nFull column rank if \\text{rank}(\\mathbf{X}) = p (all columns are independent)\nRank deficiency if \\text{rank}(\\mathbf{X}) &lt; p (multicollinearity exists)\n\nFull column rank is required for \\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{X} to be invertible in regression.\n\n\nA.1.7 Quadratic Forms\nA quadratic form is an expression of the type:\n\n\\mathbf{x}^T\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{x} = \\sum_{i=1}^n\\sum_{j=1}^n a_{ij}x_ix_j\n\nFor a vector \\mathbf{x} = \\begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\\\ x_2 \\end{bmatrix} and matrix \\mathbf{A} = \\begin{bmatrix} a_{11} & a_{12} \\\\ a_{21} & a_{22} \\end{bmatrix}:\n\n\\mathbf{x}^T\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{x} = a_{11}x_1^2 + (a_{12}+a_{21})x_1x_2 + a_{22}x_2^2\n\nThis is crucial for understanding the OLS objective function.\n\n\n\nA.2 OLS Minimization Problem and Derivation\n\nA.2.1 The Objective Function\nIn matrix notation, the linear regression model is:\n\n\\mathbf{y} = \\mathbf{X}\\boldsymbol{\\beta} + \\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}\n\nwhere:\n\n\\mathbf{y} is an n \\times 1 vector of observed responses\n\\mathbf{X} is an n \\times (p+1) design matrix of predictors (including intercept)\n\\boldsymbol{\\beta} is a (p+1) \\times 1 vector of regression coefficients\n\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon} is an n \\times 1 vector of errors\n\nThe sum of squared residuals (SSR) is:\n\nS(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}) = \\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \\mathbf{x}_i^T\\boldsymbol{\\beta})^2\n\nIn matrix form, this becomes:\n\nS(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}) = (\\mathbf{y} - \\mathbf{X}\\boldsymbol{\\beta})^T(\\mathbf{y} - \\mathbf{X}\\boldsymbol{\\beta})\n\n\n\nA.2.2 Expanding the Objective Function\nLet’s expand the expression:\n\nS(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}) = (\\mathbf{y}^T - \\boldsymbol{\\beta}^T\\mathbf{X}^T)(\\mathbf{y} - \\mathbf{X}\\boldsymbol{\\beta})\n\n\n= \\mathbf{y}^T\\mathbf{y} - \\mathbf{y}^T\\mathbf{X}\\boldsymbol{\\beta} - \\boldsymbol{\\beta}^T\\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{y} + \\boldsymbol{\\beta}^T\\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{X}\\boldsymbol{\\beta}\n\nNote that \\mathbf{y}^T\\mathbf{X}\\boldsymbol{\\beta} is a scalar, so it equals its transpose:\n\n\\mathbf{y}^T\\mathbf{X}\\boldsymbol{\\beta} = (\\mathbf{y}^T\\mathbf{X}\\boldsymbol{\\beta})^T = \\boldsymbol{\\beta}^T\\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{y}\n\nTherefore:\n\nS(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}) = \\mathbf{y}^T\\mathbf{y} - 2\\boldsymbol{\\beta}^T\\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{y} + \\boldsymbol{\\beta}^T\\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{X}\\boldsymbol{\\beta}\n\n\n\nA.2.3 Taking the Derivative\nTo minimize S(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}), we take the derivative with respect to \\boldsymbol{\\beta} and set it equal to zero.\nMatrix calculus rules needed:\n\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\boldsymbol{\\beta}}(\\mathbf{a}^T\\boldsymbol{\\beta}) = \\mathbf{a}\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\boldsymbol{\\beta}}(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}^T\\mathbf{A}\\boldsymbol{\\beta}) = 2\\mathbf{A}\\boldsymbol{\\beta} (when \\mathbf{A} is symmetric)\n\nApplying these rules:\n\n\\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial \\boldsymbol{\\beta}} = -2\\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{y} + 2\\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{X}\\boldsymbol{\\beta}\n\n\n\nA.2.4 Setting the Derivative to Zero (Normal Equations)\nSet \\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial \\boldsymbol{\\beta}} = \\mathbf{0}:\n\n-2\\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{y} + 2\\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{X}\\boldsymbol{\\beta} = \\mathbf{0}\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{X}\\boldsymbol{\\beta} = \\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{y}\n\nThese are called the normal equations.\n\n\nA.2.5 Solving for \\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}\nAssuming \\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{X} is invertible (full rank assumption), multiply both sides by (\\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{X})^{-1}:\n\n\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}} = (\\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{X})^{-1}\\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{y}\n\nThis is the OLS estimator.\n\n\nA.2.6 Verifying This is a Minimum\nTo confirm this is a minimum (not maximum or saddle point), we check the second derivative:\n\n\\frac{\\partial^2 S}{\\partial \\boldsymbol{\\beta} \\partial \\boldsymbol{\\beta}^T} = 2\\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{X}\n\nThis is the Hessian matrix. Since \\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{X} is positive definite (when \\mathbf{X} has full column rank), the Hessian is positive definite, confirming we have a minimum.\n\n\n\nA.3 Case 1: Simple Linear Regression (One Predictor)\n\nA.3.1 Setting Up the Problem\nConsider the following dataset with n = 5 observations:\n\n\n\nObservation\nx\ny\n\n\n\n\n1\n1\n2\n\n\n2\n2\n4\n\n\n3\n3\n5\n\n\n4\n4\n4\n\n\n5\n5\n5\n\n\n\nOur model is: y_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_i + \\epsilon_i\n\n\nA.3.2 Constructing the Design Matrix\nThe design matrix \\mathbf{X} includes a column of ones for the intercept:\n\n\\mathbf{X} = \\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 1 \\\\\n1 & 2 \\\\\n1 & 3 \\\\\n1 & 4 \\\\\n1 & 5\n\\end{bmatrix}, \\quad\n\\mathbf{y} = \\begin{bmatrix}\n2 \\\\\n4 \\\\\n5 \\\\\n4 \\\\\n5\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\n\n\nA.3.3 Step 1: Calculate \\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{X}\n\n\\mathbf{X}^T = \\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\n\n\\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{X} = \\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 1 \\\\\n1 & 2 \\\\\n1 & 3 \\\\\n1 & 4 \\\\\n1 & 5\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\nElement-by-element calculation:\n\n(1,1) element: 1(1) + 1(1) + 1(1) + 1(1) + 1(1) = 5\n(1,2) element: 1(1) + 1(2) + 1(3) + 1(4) + 1(5) = 15\n(2,1) element: 1(1) + 2(1) + 3(1) + 4(1) + 5(1) = 15\n(2,2) element: 1(1) + 2(2) + 3(3) + 4(4) + 5(5) = 1 + 4 + 9 + 16 + 25 = 55\n\n\n\\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{X} = \\begin{bmatrix}\n5 & 15 \\\\\n15 & 55\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\n\n\nA.3.4 Step 2: Calculate (\\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{X})^{-1}\nFor a 2 \\times 2 matrix \\mathbf{A} = \\begin{bmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d \\end{bmatrix}, the inverse is:\n\n\\mathbf{A}^{-1} = \\frac{1}{ad -

For unbiasedness:\n\nE[\\tilde{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}] = \\mathbf{C}E[\\mathbf{y}] = \\mathbf{C}\\mathbf{X}\\boldsymbol{\\beta} = \\boldsymbol{\\beta}\n\nThis requires \\mathbf{C}\\mathbf{X} = \\mathbf{I}.\nWe can write \\mathbf{C} = (\\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{X})^{-1}\\mathbf{X}^T + \\mathbf{D} for some matrix \\mathbf{D} where \\mathbf{D}\\mathbf{X} = \\mathbf{0}.\nThe variance of \\tilde{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}} is:\n\n\\text{Var}(\\tilde{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}) = \\sigma^2\\mathbf{C}\\mathbf{C}^T\n\n\n= \\sigma^2[(\\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{X})^{-1}\\mathbf{X}^T + \\mathbf{D}][(\\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{X})^{-1}\\mathbf{X}^T + \\mathbf{D}]^T\n\n\n= \\sigma^2(\\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{X})^{-1} + \\sigma^2\\mathbf{D}\\mathbf{D}^T\n\nSince \\mathbf{D}\\mathbf{D}^T is positive semi-definite:\n\n\\text{Var}(\\tilde{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}) - \\text{Var}(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}) = \\sigma^2\\mathbf{D}\\mathbf{D}^T \\geq \\mathbf{0}\n\nTherefore, OLS has the smallest variance among all linear unbiased estimators.\n\n\n\nA.6 Key Takeaways\n\nMatrix notation provides an elegant and scalable framework for regression that extends naturally from simple to multiple regression.\nThe OLS minimization derives from setting \\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial \\boldsymbol{\\beta}} = \\mathbf{0}, yielding the normal equations \\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{X}\\boldsymbol{\\beta} = \\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{y}.\nThe OLS solution \\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}} = (\\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{X})^{-1}\\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{y} requires that \\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{X} be invertible (no perfect multicollinearity).\nUnder the Gauss-Markov assumptions, OLS is BLUE: Best (minimum variance), Linear, Unbiased Estimator.\nThe variance of OLS estimates is \\sigma^2(\\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{X})^{-1}, which can be used for inference.\nKey linear algebra tools include matrix transpose, multiplication, determinant, inverse, and rank—all essential for understanding OLS.\nAssumption violations (e.g., heteroscedasticity, autocorrelation) don’t make OLS biased, but they invalidate the “best” property and standard inference procedures.",

Korelacja mierzy statystyczny związek między zmiennymi, natomiast przyczynowość oznacza bezpośredni wpływ jednej zmiennej na drugą.\nZależności statystyczne stanowią fundament podejmowania decyzji opartych na danych w wielu dyscyplinach — od ekonomii i zdrowia publicznego po psychologię i nauki o środowisku. Zrozumienie, kiedy związek wskazuje jedynie na asocjację (association), a kiedy na prawdziwą kausalność (genuine causality), jest kluczowe dla poprawnych wniosków i skutecznych rekomendacji politycznych.",

To zestaw narzędzi matematycznych do identyfikowania wzorców w danych, które umożliwiają prognozowanie (prediction).\nRozważ pytania badawcze:\n\nJak czas nauki wpływa na wynik testu?\nJak doświadczenie wpływa na wynagrodzenie?\nJak wydatki na reklamę oddziałują na sprzedaż?\n\nRegresja dostarcza systematycznych metod, by na te pytania odpowiadać na podstawie realnych danych.\n\n\nPunkt wyjścia: prosty przykład\nZacznijmy od konkretu. Zebrano dane o 20 studentach z Twojej klasy:\n\n\n\nStudent\nStudy Hours\nExam Score\n\n\n\n\nAlex\n2\n68\n\n\nBeth\n4\n74\n\n\nCarlos\n6\n85\n\n\nDiana\n8\n91\n\n\n…\n…\n…\n\n\n\nPo narysowaniu wykresu punktowego (scatter plot) chcesz znaleźć prostą, która najlepiej opisuje związek między godzinami nauki a wynikiem.\nAle co znaczy „najlepiej”? Właśnie to odkryjemy.\n\n\nDlaczego prawdziwe dane nie układają się w idealną linię\nZanim przejdziemy do rachunków, zrozummy, dlaczego punkty zwykle nie leżą na jednej prostej.\n\nModele deterministyczne vs. stochastyczne\nModele deterministyczne (deterministic models) opisują związki bez niepewności.

Innymi słowy, systemy wyborcze z większymi okręgami (więcej przedstawicieli wybieranych z jednego okręgu) zwykle dają bardziej proporcjonalne wyniki (niższa dysproporcjonalność).\n\nOdkrycie to jest zgodne z teorią nauk politycznych, która sugeruje, że większe okręgi zapewniają więcej możliwości mniejszym partiom, aby uzyskać reprezentację, co prowadzi do wyników wyborczych, które lepiej odzwierciedlają rozkład głosów między partiami.\n\n\n\nKrok 4: Skonstruowanie modelu regresji liniowej prostej i obliczenie R-kwadrat\nFormuła dla regresji liniowej prostej:\nLH = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\cdot DM + \\varepsilon\nGdzie:\n\n\\beta_0 to wyraz wolny (przecięcie)\n\\beta_1 to współczynnik nachylenia dla DM\n\nFormuła do obliczenia \\beta_1 to:\n\\beta_1 = \\frac{Cov(DM, LH)}{\\sigma^2_{DM}} = \\frac{-1.75}{3.5} = -0.5\nAby obliczyć \\beta_0, używam:\n\\beta_0 = \\bar{y} - \\beta_1 \\cdot \\bar{x} = 13.75 - (-0.5) \\cdot 5.5 = 13.75 + 2.75 = 16.5\nZatem równanie regresji to:\nLH = 16.5 - 0.5 \\cdot DM\n\nObliczanie wartości przewidywanych i błędów\nUżywając naszego równania regresji, obliczam przewidywane wartości LH:\n\\hat{LH} = 16.5 - 0.5 \\cdot DM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKraj\nDM (x_i)\nLH (y_i)\nPrzewidywane LH (\\hat{y}_i = 16.5 - 0.5x_i)\nBłąd (y_i - \\hat{y}_i)\nBłąd bezwzględny (|y_i - \\hat{y}_i|)\nBłąd kwadratowy ([y_i - \\hat{y}_i]^2)\n\n\n\n\nA\n3\n15.5\n16.5 - 0.5(3) = 16.5 - 1.5 = 15\n15.5 - 15 = 0.5\n|0.5| = 0.5\n(0.5)^2 = 0.25\n\n\nB\n4\n14.25\n16.5 - 0.5(4) = 16.5 - 2 = 14.5\n14.25 - 14.5 = -0.25\n|-0.25| = 0.25\n(-0.25)^2 = 0.0625\n\n\nC\n5\n13.5\n16.5 - 0.5(5) = 16.5 - 2.5 = 14\n13.5 - 14 = -0.5\n|-0.5| = 0.5\n(-0.5)^2 = 0.25\n\n\nD\n6\n13.5\n16.5 - 0.5(6) = 16.5 - 3 = 13.5\n13.5 - 13.5 = 0\n|0| = 0\n(0)^2 = 0\n\n\nE\n7\n13\n16.5 - 0.5(7) = 16.5 - 3.5 = 13\n13 - 13 = 0\n|0| = 0\n(0)^2 = 0\n\n\nF\n8\n12.75\n16.5 - 0.5(8) = 16.5 - 4 = 12.5\n12.75 - 12.5 = 0.25\n|0.25| = 0.25\n(0.25)^2 = 0.0625\n\n\nSuma\n\n\n\n\n1.5\n0.625\n\n\n\n\n\nObliczanie R-kwadrat\n\nSST (Całkowita suma kwadratów)\n\nSST = \\sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_i - \\bar{y})^2\nObliczyliśmy już te odchylenia w Kroku 1:\n\n\n\nKraj\nLH (y_i)\ny_i - \\bar{y}\n(y_i - \\bar{y})^2\n\n\n\n\nA\n15.5\n1.75\n3.0625\n\n\nB\n14.25\n0.5\n0.25\n\n\nC\n13.5\n-0.25\n0.0625\n\n\nD\n13.5\n-0.25\n0.0625\n\n\nE\n13\n-0.75\n0.5625\n\n\nF\n12.75\n-1\n1\n\n\nSuma\n\n\n5\n\n\n\nSST = 5\n\nSSR (Suma kwadratów regresji)\n\nSSR = \\sum_{i=1}^{n}(\\hat{y}_i - \\bar{y})^2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKraj\nPrzewidywane LH (\\hat{y}_i)\n\\hat{y}_i - \\bar{y}\n(\\hat{y}_i - \\bar{y})^2\n\n\n\n\nA\n15\n15 - 13.75 = 1.25\n(1.25)^2 = 1.5625\n\n\nB\n14.5\n14.5 - 13.75 = 0.75\n(0.75)^2 = 0.5625\n\n\nC\n14\n14 - 13.75 = 0.25\n(0.25)^2 = 0.0625\n\n\nD\n13.5\n13.5 - 13.75 = -0.25\n(-0.25)^2 = 0.0625\n\n\nE\n13\n13 - 13.75 = -0.75\n(-0.75)^2 = 0.5625\n\n\nF\n12.5\n12.5 - 13.75 = -1.25\n(-1.25)^2 = 1.5625\n\n\nSuma\n\n\n4.375\n\n\n\nSSR = 4.375\n\nSSE (Suma kwadratów błędów)\n\nSSE = \\sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2\nZ tabeli powyżej, suma kwadratów błędów wynosi:\nSSE = 0.625\n\nWeryfikacja\n\nMożemy zweryfikować nasze obliczenia sprawdzając, czy SST = SSR + SSE:\n5 = 4.375 + 0.625 = 5 \\checkmark\n\nObliczanie R-kwadrat\n\nR^2 = \\frac{SSR}{SST} = \\frac{4.375}{5} = 0.875\n\n\nObliczanie RMSE (Root Mean Square Error)\nRMSE jest obliczane przy użyciu formuły:\nRMSE = \\sqrt{\\frac{SSE}{n}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2}{n}}\nUżywając naszego obliczonego SSE:\nRMSE = \\sqrt{\\frac{0.625}{6}} = \\sqrt{0.104} \\approx 0.323\n\n\nObliczanie MAE (Mean Absolute Error)\nMAE jest obliczane przy użyciu formuły:\nMAE = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}|y_i - \\hat{y}_i|}{n}\nUżywając sum z tabeli:\nMAE = \\frac{1.5}{6} = 0.25\nModel regresji: LH = 16.5 - 0.5 \\cdot DM\nR-kwadrat: 0.875\nRMSE: 0.323\nMAE: 0.25\n\n\nInterpretacja:\n\nRównanie regresji: Dla każdego wzrostu jednostkowego wielkości okręgu, indeks dysproporcjonalności LH jest oczekiwany spadek o 0.5 jednostki. Wyraz wolny (16.5) reprezentuje oczekiwany indeks LH, gdy wielkość okręgu wynosi zero (choć nie ma to praktycznego znaczenia, ponieważ wielkość okręgu nie może wynosić zero).\nR-kwadrat: 0.875 wskazuje, że około 87.5% wariancji w dysproporcjonalności wyborczej (indeks LH) może być wyjaśnione przez wielkość okręgu. Jest to wysoka wartość, sugerująca, że wielkość okręgu jest rzeczywiście silnym predyktorem dysproporcjonalności wyborczej.\nRMSE i MAE: Niskie wartości RMSE (0.323) i MAE (0.25) wskazują, że model dobrze dopasowuje się do danych, z małymi błędami predykcji.\nImplikacje polityczne: Odkrycia sugerują, że zwiększanie wielkości okręgu mogłoby być skuteczną strategią reformy wyborczej dla krajów dążących do zmniejszenia dysproporcjonalności między głosami a mandatami. Jednak korzyści marginalne wydają się zmniejszać wraz ze wzrostem wielkości okręgu, jak widać w wzorcu danych.",

Innymi słowy, systemy wyborcze z większymi okręgami wyborczymi (więcej przedstawicieli wybieranych w okręgu) mają tendencję do generowania bardziej proporcjonalnych wyników (mniejsza dysproporcjonalność).\n\nUstalenie to jest zgodne z teorią nauk politycznych, która sugeruje, że większe okręgi wyborcze zapewniają mniejszym partiom więcej możliwości uzyskania reprezentacji, co prowadzi do wyników wyborczych, które lepiej odzwierciedlają rozkład głosów między partiami.\n\n\n\nKrok 4: Skonstruowanie prostego modelu regresji liniowej i obliczenie R-kwadrat\nUżyję wzoru na prostą regresję liniową:\nLH = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\cdot DM + \\varepsilon\nGdzie:\n\n\\beta_0 to wyraz wolny\n\\beta_1 to współczynnik nachylenia dla DM\n\nWzór na obliczenie \\beta_1 z korektą Bessela to:\n\\beta_1 = \\frac{Cov(DM, LH)}{s^2_{DM}} = \\frac{-7.4}{7.6} = -0.974\nAby obliczyć \\beta_0, użyję:\n\\beta_0 = \\bar{y} -

Wyraz wolny (16.511) reprezentuje oczekiwany wskaźnik LH, gdy wielkość okręgu wynosi zero (choć nie ma to praktycznego znaczenia, ponieważ wielkość okręgu nie może wynosić zero).\nR-kwadrat: 0.651 wskazuje, że około 65.1% wariancji dysproporcjonalności wyborczej (wskaźnik LH) może być wyjaśnione przez wielkość okręgu. Jest to dość wysoka wartość, sugerująca, że wielkość okręgu jest rzeczywiście silnym predyktorem dysproporcjonalności wyborczej, choć mniejszym niż w poprzednim zestawie danych.\nRMSE: Wartość 1.794 informuje nas o przeciętnym błędzie prognozy modelu. Jest to miara dokładności przewidywań modelu wyrażona w jednostkach zmiennej zależnej (LH).\nMAE: Wartość 1.436 informuje nas o przeciętnym bezwzględnym błędzie prognozy modelu. W porównaniu z RMSE, MAE jest mniej czuły na wartości odstające, co potwierdza, że niektóre obserwacje (np. dla kraju E) mają stosunkowo duży błąd predykcji.\nImplikacje polityczne: Wyniki sugerują, że zwiększenie wielkości okręgu mogłoby być skuteczną strategią reform wyborczych dla krajów starających się zmniejszyć dysproporcjonalność między głosami a mandatami. Jednakże, korzyści marginalne wydają się zmniejszać wraz ze wzrostem wielkości okręgu, jak widać we wzorcu danych.",

Jest nieskończenie wiele linii, które moglibyśmy narysować! Niektóre przeszłyby przez środek punktów, inne mogłyby być za wysokie lub za niskie, za strome lub za płaskie. Potrzebujemy systematycznego sposobu określenia, która linia jest “najlepsza”.\n\nCzym są Błędy (Reszty)?\nDla każdej linii, którą narysujemy, każdy punkt danych będzie miał błąd lub resztę - pionową odległość od punktu do linii. To reprezentuje, jak “błędna” jest nasza prognoza dla tego punktu.\n\nBłąd dodatni: Rzeczywista wartość jest powyżej przewidywanej wartości (niedoszacowaliśmy)\nBłąd ujemny: Rzeczywista wartość jest poniżej przewidywanej wartości (przeszacowaliśmy)\n\n\n\nDlaczego Podnosimy Błędy do Kwadratu?\nProste dodawanie błędów nie zadziała, ponieważ błędy dodatnie i ujemne się znoszą. Moglibyśmy użyć wartości bezwzględnych, ale podnoszenie do kwadratu ma kilka zalet:\n\nWygoda matematyczna: Funkcje kwadratowe są różniczkowalne, co ułatwia znalezienie minimum za pomocą rachunku różniczkowego\nPenalizuje większe błędy bardziej: Kilka dużych błędów jest gorsze niż wiele małych błędów\nTworzy gładką, miskowatą funkcję: To gwarantuje unikalne minimum\n\n\n\nWzór SSE\nSuma Kwadratów Błędów to: SSE = \\sum_{i=1}^{n}(Y_i - \\hat{Y_i})^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^{n}(Y_i - (\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_i))^2\n\n\nZnajdowanie Najlepszej Linii\n“Najlepsza” linia to ta, która minimalizuje SSE.

Jedni zarabiają 40 000, inni 80 000, a jeszcze inni 120 000. Mamy więc zmienność wynagrodzeń — nie są takie same.\n\nCałkowita zmienność (SST)\nTo pytanie: „Jak bardzo wszystkie pensje są rozproszone wokół średniej pensji?” Jeśli średnia to 70 000, to SST mierzy, o ile każda pensja różni się od 70 000, podnosi te różnice do kwadratu (żeby były dodatnie) i sumuje. To całkowita ilość zmienności, którą próbujemy wyjaśnić.\n\n\nZmienność wyjaśniona (SSR)\nZałóżmy, że budujemy model przewidujący pensję na podstawie lat doświadczenia. Model może mówić:\n\n2 lata doświadczenia → przewiduje 50 000\n5 lat doświadczenia → przewiduje 70 000\n10 lat doświadczenia → przewiduje 100 000\n\nSSR mierzy, jak bardzo te przewidywania różnią się od średniej. To ta część zmienności, którą model „wyjaśnia” relacją z doświadczeniem. Innymi słowy: „tę część różnic w pensjach da się przypisać różnym poziomom doświadczenia”.\n\n\nZmienność niewyjaśniona (SSE)\nTo to, co zostaje — część, której model nie tłumaczy. Może być tak, że dwie osoby mają po 5 lat doświadczenia, ale jedna zarabia 65 000, a druga 75 000. Model obu przewidział 70 000. Te różnice względem przewidywań (błędy) reprezentują zmienność wynikającą z innych czynników — np. edukacja, wyniki pracy, umiejętności negocjacyjne albo po prostu losowość.\n\n\n10.22 Kluczowa intuicja\nPiękne jest to, że te trzy wielkości zawsze spełniają zależność: Całkowita zmienność = Zmienność wyjaśniona + Zmienność niewyjaśniona czyli SST = SSR + SSE.\nMożesz myśleć o tym jak o „wykresie kołowym powodów, dlaczego pensje się różnią”:\n\nJeden kawałek to „różnice wyjaśnione doświadczeniem” (SSR),\nDrugi kawałek to „różnice z innych powodów” (SSE),\nRazem dają całość (SST).\n\n\n\n10.23 Dlaczego to ważne\nTo rozbicie pozwala policzyć współczynnik determinacji R^2:\n\nR^2 = \\frac{\\mathrm{SSR}}{\\mathrm{SST}} = \\frac{\\text{Zmienność wyjaśniona}}{\\text{Całkowita zmienność}}.\n\nJeśli R^2 = 0{,}70, to model wyjaśnia 70% tego, dlaczego wartości Y (tu: pensje) różnią się między sobą. Pozostałe 30% to czynniki nieuwzględnione lub szum losowy.\nPomyśl o tym jak o rozwiązywaniu zagadki: SST to cała zagadka do rozwiązania, SSR to część już rozwiązana, a SSE to to, co wciąż pozostaje do wyjaśnienia!\n\n\n\nObliczmy każdą:\nKrok 1: Oblicz przewidywane wartości\nUżywając \\hat{Y} = 89,684 - 2,451X:\n\n\n\ni\nX_i\nY_i\n\\hat{Y}_i = 89,684 - 2,451X_i\n\n\n\n\n1\n2,5\n80\n89,684 - 2,451(2,5) = 83,556\n\n\n2\n3,2\n85\n89,684 - 2,451(3,2) = 81,841\n\n\n3\n4,1\n78\n89,684 - 2,451(4,1) = 79,635\n\n\n4\n4,8\n82\n89,684 - 2,451(4,8) = 77,919\n\n\n5\n5,6\n77\n89,684 - 2,451(5,6) = 75,968\n\n\n6\n6,3\n74\n89,684 - 2,451(6,3) = 74,253\n\n\n7\n7,0\n68\n89,684 - 2,451(7,0) = 72,527\n\n\n8\n7,9\n72\n89,684 - 2,451(7,9) = 70,321\n\n\n\nKrok 2: Oblicz sumy kwadratów\nSST (Całkowita zmienność): SST = \\sum(Y_i - \\bar{Y})^2\nZ naszych wcześniejszych obliczeń wariancji: SST = (n-1) \\times s^2_Y = 7 \\times 30,5714 = 214\nSSE (Niewyjaśniona zmienność): SSE = \\sum(Y_i - \\hat{Y}_i)^2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ni\nY_i\n\\hat{Y}_i\nY_i - \\hat{Y}_i\n(Y_i - \\hat{Y}_i)^2\n\n\n\n\n1\n80\n83,556\n-3,556\n12,645\n\n\n2\n85\n81,841\n3,159\n9,979\n\n\n3\n78\n79,635\n-1,635\n2,673\n\n\n4\n82\n77,919\n4,081\n16,655\n\n\n5\n77\n75,968\n1,032\n1,065\n\n\n6\n74\n74,253\n-0,253\n0,064\n\n\n7\n68\n72,527\n-4,527\n20,494\n\n\n8\n72\n70,321\n1,679\n2,819\n\n\nSuma\n\n\n\n66,394\n\n\n\nSSR (Wyjaśniona zmienność): SSR = SST - SSE = 214 - 66,394 = 147,606\n\n# Weryfikacja obliczeń\ntabela_anova &lt;- anova(model)\ncat(\"SSR (Regresja):\", tabela_anova$`Sum Sq`[1], \"\\n\")\n\nSSR (Regresja): 147.5887 \n\ncat(\"SSE (Reszty):\", tabela_anova$`Sum Sq`[2], \"\\n\")\n\nSSE (Reszty): 66.41132 \n\ncat(\"SST (Całkowita):\", sum(tabela_anova$`Sum Sq`), \"\\n\")\n\nSST (Całkowita): 214 \n\n\n\n\nR-kwadrat (Współczynnik Determinacji)\nR-kwadrat mówi nam, jaka część całkowitej zmienności w Y jest wyjaśniona przez nasz model:\nR^2 = \\frac{SSR}{SST} = \\frac{147,606}{214} = 0,690\nTo oznacza, że nasz model wyjaśnia 69,0% zmienności w wynikach egzaminu.\nAlternatywny wzór używający korelacji: R^2 = r^2 = (-0,831)^2 = 0,691\n\n# Weryfikacja R-kwadrat\ncat(\"R-kwadrat:\", summary(model)$r.squared, \"\\n\")\n\nR-kwadrat: 0.6896667 \n\ncat(\"Korelacja do kwadratu:\", cor(lęk, wyniki)^2, \"\\n\")\n\nKorelacja do kwadratu: 0.6896667 \n\n\n\n\n\nWielkość Efektu\nWspółczynnik nachylenia \\hat{\\beta_1} = -2,451 to nasza wielkość efektu.
