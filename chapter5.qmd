# Fundamentals of Univariate Descriptive Statistics

Descriptive statistics are fundamental tools in social science research, providing a concise summary of data characteristics. They serve several crucial functions:

-   Summarizing large datasets into manageable information
-   Identifying patterns and trends in data
-   Detecting potential anomalies or outliers
-   Providing a foundation for further statistical analysis

## Introduction to Sigma Notation (Σ)

-   **What is Sigma summation notation?** Sigma (Σ) is a mathematical operator that instructs us to sum (add) a sequence of terms - it functions as a directive to perform addition of all elements within a specified range.
-   **Purpose:** Provides a concise way to write sums of many similar terms using a single symbol, avoiding lengthy addition expressions.

### Basic Formula

-   The general form of sigma notation is: $$\sum_{i=a}^{b} f(i)$$
-   **Summation index:** $i$
-   **Lower bound:** $a$
-   **Upper bound:** $b$
-   **Function:** $f(i)$

### Examples of Sigma Notation Applications

#### Simple Example: Sum of Natural Numbers

-   Suppose you want to add the first five positive integers: $\sum_{i=1}^{5} i = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15$
-   The above notation adds the first five positive integers.

#### Sum of Squares

-   Suppose you want to sum the squares of the first four positive integers: $\sum_{i=1}^{4} i^2 = 1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + 4^2 = 1 + 4 + 9 + 16 = 30$
-   This is the sum of squares of the first four positive integers.

#### Sum of a Constant Value

-   Summing a constant value $c$ for $n$ terms: $\sum_{i=1}^{n} c = c + c + c + ... + c \text{ (n times)} = n \cdot c$
-   **Example**: Sum of five fives: $\sum_{i=1}^{5} 5 = 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 = 5 \cdot 5 = 25$

### Simple Examples in Statistical Context

$$\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i$$ - **Summation index:** $i$ (typically denotes a specific observation in a dataset) - **Lower bound:** 1 (we usually start from the first observation) - **Upper bound:** $n$ (total number of observations in our dataset) - **Expression:** $x_i$ (value of the $i$th observation)

#### Summing Observation Values

-   We have a dataset: 5, 8, 12, 15, 20
-   Sum of all values: $$\sum_{i=1}^{5} x_i = x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 + x_5 = 5 + 8 + 12 + 15 + 20 = 60$$
-   This sum is a key element when calculating the arithmetic mean.

#### Sum of Deviations from the Mean

-   For the same dataset (5, 8, 12, 15, 20), the mean is $\bar{x} = 60/5 = 12$
-   Sum of deviations from the mean: $$\sum_{i=1}^{5} (x_i - \bar{x}) = (5-12) + (8-12) + (12-12) + (15-12) + (20-12)$$ $$= -7 + (-4) + 0 + 3 + 8 = 0$$
-   **Important observation:** The sum of deviations from the mean always equals 0, which is a fundamental property of the arithmetic mean.

### Summary

-   Sigma Notation (Σ) allows for concise expression of key statistical formulas
-   The most important applications include calculating:
    -   Arithmetic mean
    -   Variance and standard deviation
    -   Various sums of squares used in regression analysis

## Summation (Σ) and Product (Π) Operators

#### Sigma (Σ) Operator

$\sum$ is a **summation operator** that instructs us to add terms:

$\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i = x_1 + x_2 + ... + x_n$

where: - $i$ is the index variable - The lower value under Σ (here $i=1$) is the starting point - The upper value (here $n$) is the ending point

#### Pi (Π) Operator

$\prod$ is a **product operator** that instructs us to multiply terms:

$\prod_{i=1}^{n} x_i = x_1 \times x_2 \times ... \times x_n$

where: - $i$ is the index variable - The lower value under Π (here $i=1$) is the starting point - The upper value (here $n$) is the ending point

## Types of Data Distributions

::: callout-important
**Data distribution informs what values a variable takes and how often**.
:::

Understanding data distributions is crucial for data analysis and visualization. In this document, we'll explore various types of distributions and how to visualize them using ggplot2 in R.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
library(palmerpenguins)
set.seed(123)  # for reproducibility
```

### Normal Distribution

The normal distribution, also known as the Gaussian distribution, is symmetric and bell-shaped.

```{r}
# Generate normal distribution data
normal_data <- data.frame(x = rnorm(1000))

# Plot
ggplot(normal_data, aes(x)) +
  geom_histogram(aes(y = ..density..), bins = 30, fill = "skyblue", color = "black") +
  geom_density(color = "red") +
  labs(title = "Normal Distribution", x = "Value", y = "Density")
```

### Uniform Distribution

In a uniform distribution, all values have an equal probability of occurrence.

```{r}
# Generate uniform distribution data
uniform_data <- data.frame(x = runif(1000))

# Plot
ggplot(uniform_data, aes(x)) +
  geom_histogram(aes(y = ..density..), bins = 30, fill = "lightgreen", color = "black") +
  geom_density(color = "red") +
  labs(title = "Uniform Distribution", x = "Value", y = "Density")
```

### Skewed Distributions

Skewed distributions are asymmetric, with one tail longer than the other.

```{r}
# Generate right-skewed data
right_skewed <- data.frame(x = rlnorm(1000))

# Plot
ggplot(right_skewed, aes(x)) +
  geom_histogram(aes(y = ..density..), bins = 30, fill = "lightyellow", color = "black") +
  geom_density(color = "red") +
  labs(title = "Right-Skewed Distribution", x = "Value", y = "Density")
```

### Bimodal Distribution

A bimodal distribution has two peaks, indicating two distinct subgroups in the data.

```{r}
# Generate bimodal data
bimodal_data <- data.frame(x = c(rnorm(500, mean = -2), rnorm(500, mean = 2)))

# Plot
ggplot(bimodal_data, aes(x)) +
  geom_histogram(aes(y = ..density..), bins = 30, fill = "lightpink", color = "black") +
  geom_density(color = "red") +
  labs(title = "Bimodal Distribution", x = "Value", y = "Density")
```

| Distribution | Key Properties | Examples |
|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| Symmetric (Normal) | Symmetric, bell-shaped, most values close to the mean | Adult height in population, IQ test scores, measurement errors, standardized exam results |
| Uniform | Equal probability across the entire range | Last digit of phone numbers, random day of the week selection, position of pointer after spinning a wheel of fortune |
| Bimodal | Two distinct peaks, suggests presence of subgroups | Age structure in university towns (students and permanent residents), opinions on strongly polarizing topics, traffic intensity hours (morning and afternoon peak) |
| Right-skewed (Positively skewed) | Extended "tail" on the right side, most values less than the mean | Queue waiting time, commute time to work, age at first marriage |
| Heavy-tailed skewed (Log-normal) | Strong right asymmetry, values cannot be negative, long "fat tail" | Personal income, housing prices, household size |
| Extreme-tailed skewed (Power law) | Extreme asymmetry, "rich get richer" effect, no characteristic scale | Wealth of the richest individuals, city populations, number of followers on social media, number of citations of scientific publications |

## Visualizing Real-World Data Distributions

Let's use the `palmerpenguins` dataset to explore data distributions.

### Histogram and Density Plot

::: callout-note
## Understanding Histograms and Density

⭐ A histogram is a special graph for numerical data where:

-   Data is grouped into ranges (called "bins")
-   Bars touch each other (unlike bar charts!) because the data is continuous
-   Each bar's height shows how many values fall into that range

Think of density as showing how *common* or *concentrated* certain values are in your data:

-   A higher point on a density curve (or taller bar in a histogram) means those values appear more frequently in your data
-   A lower point means those values are less common

Just like a crowded area has more people per space (higher density), a taller part of the graph shows values that appear more often in your dataset!
:::

```{r}
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = flipper_length_mm)) +
  geom_histogram(aes(y = ..density..), bins = 30, fill = "lightblue", color = "black") +
  geom_density(color = "red") +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Penguin Flipper Lengths", 
       x = "Flipper Length (mm)", 
       y = "Density")
```

### Box Plot

Box plots are useful for comparing distributions across categories.

```{r}
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = species, y = body_mass_g, fill = species)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Penguin Body Mass by Species", 
       x = "Species", 
       y = "Body Mass (g)")
```

### Violin Plot

Violin plots combine box plot and density plot features.

```{r}
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = species, y = body_mass_g, fill = species)) +
  geom_violin(trim = FALSE) +
  geom_boxplot(width = 0.1, fill = "white") +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Penguin Body Mass by Species", 
       x = "Species", 
       y = "Body Mass (g)")
```

### Ridgeline Plot

Ridgeline plots are useful for comparing multiple distributions.

```{r}
library(ggridges)

ggplot(penguins, aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = species, fill = species)) +
  geom_density_ridges(alpha = 0.6) +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Flipper Length by Penguin Species",
       x = "Flipper Length (mm)",
       y = "Species")
```

### Conclusion

Understanding and visualizing data distributions is crucial in data analysis. ggplot2 provides a flexible and powerful toolkit for creating various types of distribution plots. By exploring different visualization techniques, we can gain insights into the underlying patterns and characteristics of our data.

## Understanding Outliers

Before diving into specific measures, it's crucial to understand the concept of outliers, as they can significantly impact many descriptive statistics.

Outliers are data points that differ significantly from other observations in the dataset. They can occur due to:

-   Measurement or recording errors
-   Genuine extreme values in the population

Outliers can have a substantial effect on many statistical measures, especially those based on means or sums of squared deviations. Therefore, it's essential to:

1.  Identify outliers through both statistical methods and domain knowledge
2.  Investigate the cause of outliers
3.  Make informed decisions about whether to include or exclude them in analyses

Throughout this guide, we'll discuss how different descriptive measures are affected by outliers.

## Statistical Symbols and Notations - Summary

| Measure | Population Parameter | Sample Statistic | Alternative Notations | Usage Notes |
|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|
| Size | $N$ | $n$ | \- | Total count of observations |
| Mean | $\mu$ | $\bar{x}$, $m$ | $M$, $E(X)$ | $E(X)$ used in probability theory |
| Variance | $\sigma^2$ | $s^2$ | $\text{Var}(X)$, $V(X)$ | Squared deviations from mean |
| Standard Deviation | $\sigma$ | $s$ | $\text{SD}$, $\text{std}$ | Square root of variance |
| Proportion | $\pi$, $P$ | $\hat{p}$ | $\text{prop}$ | Relative frequencies |
| Correlation | $\rho$ | $r$ | $\text{corr}(x,y)$ | Ranges from -1 to +1 |
| Standard Error | $\sigma_{\bar{x}}$ | $s_{\bar{x}}$ | $\text{SE}$ | Standard error of mean |
| Sum | $\sum$ | $\sum$ | $\sum_{i=1}^n$ | With indexing |
| Individual Value | $X_i$ | $x_i$ | \- | $i$th observation |
| Covariance | $\sigma_{xy}$ | $s_{xy}$ | $\text{Cov}(X,Y)$ | Joint variation |
| Median | $\eta$ | $\text{Med}$ | $M$ | Central value |
| Range | $R$ | $r$ | $\text{max}(X) - \text{min}(X)$ | Spread measure |
| Mode | $\text{Mo}$ | $\text{mo}$ | $\text{mod}$ | Most frequent value |
| Skewness | $\gamma_1$ | $g_1$ | $\text{SK}$ | Distribution asymmetry |
| Kurtosis | $\gamma_2$ | $g_2$ | $\text{KU}$ | Distribution peakedness |

Additional useful notations:

-   Sample moments: $m_k = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \bar{x})^k$
-   Population moments: $\mu_k = E[(X - \mu)^k]$

## Measures of Central Tendency

Measures of central tendency aim to identify the "typical" or "central" value in a dataset. The three primary measures are mean, median, and mode.

### Arithmetic Mean

The arithmetic mean is the sum of all values divided by the number of values.

**Formula:** $\bar{x} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n x_i$

**Important Property:** The mean is a balancing point in the data. The sum of deviations from the mean is always zero:

$\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \bar{x}) = 0$

This property makes the mean useful in many statistical calculations.

::: callout-note
## Understanding Mean as a Balance Point 🎯

Let's consider a dataset $X = \{1, 2, 6, 7, 9\}$ on a number line, imagining it as a seesaw:

![https://www.gastonsanchez.com/matrix4sl/mean-as-a-balancing-point.html](stat_imgs/IMG_4336.jpg)

The mean ($\mu$) acts as the perfect **balance point** of this seesaw. For our data:

$\mu = \frac{1 + 2 + 6 + 7 + 9}{5} = 5$

### What happens at different support points? 🤔

1.  **Support point at 6** (too high):
    -   Left side: Values (1, 2) are below
    -   Right side: Values (7, 9) are above
    -   $\sum$ distances from left = (6-1) + (6-2) = 9
    -   $\sum$ distances from right = (7-6) + (9-6) = 4
    -   The seesaw tilts left! ⬅️ because 9 \> 4
2.  **Support point at 4** (too low):
    -   Left side: Values (1, 2) are below
    -   Right side: Values (6, 7, 9) are above
    -   $\sum$ distances from left = (4-1) + (4-2) = 5
    -   $\sum$ distances from right = (6-4) + (7-4) + (9-4) = 10
    -   The seesaw tilts right! ➡️ because 5 \< 10
3.  **Support point at mean (5)** (perfect balance):
    -   $\sum$ distances below = $\sum$ distances above
    -   $((5-1) + (5-2)) = ((6-5) + (7-5) + (9-5))$
    -   $7 = 7$ ✨ Perfect balance!

This shows why the mean is the unique balance point, where:

$\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \mu) = 0$

The seesaw will always tilt unless the support point is placed exactly at the mean! 🎪

### Mean as a Balance Point

This visualization shows how the arithmetic mean (5) acts as a balance point between clustered points on the left and dispersed points on the right:

Left side of the mean: - Points with values 2 and 3 - Close together (difference of 1 unit) - Distances from mean: 3 and 2 units - Sum of "pull" = 5 units

Right side of the mean: - Points with values 6 and 9 - More spread out (difference of 3 units) - Distances from mean: 1 and 4 units - Sum of "pull" = 5 units

Key observations:

1.  The mean (5) is a balance point, even though:
    -   Points on the left are clustered (2,3)
    -   Points on the right are dispersed (6,9)
    -   Green arrows show distances from the mean
2.  Balance is maintained because:
    -   Sum of distances balances out: (5-2) + (5-3) = (6-5) + (9-5)
    -   Total sum of distances = 5 units on each side

**Manual Calculation Example:**

Let's calculate the mean for the dataset: 2, 4, 4, 5, 5, 7, 9

| Step | Description                | Calculation                    |
|------|----------------------------|--------------------------------|
| 1    | Sum all values             | 2 + 4 + 4 + 5 + 5 + 7 + 9 = 36 |
| 2    | Count the number of values | n = 7                          |
| 3    | Divide the sum by n        | 36 / 7 = 5.14                  |

**R calculation:**

```{r}
data <- c(2, 4, 4, 5, 5, 7, 9)
mean(data)
```

**Pros:**

-   Easy to calculate and understand
-   Uses all data points
-   Useful for further statistical calculations

**Cons:**

-   Sensitive to outliers
-   Not ideal for skewed distributions

**Example with outlier:**

```{r}
data_with_outlier <- c(2, 4, 4, 5, 5, 7, 100)
mean(data_with_outlier)
```

As we can see, the outlier (100) drastically affects the mean.

### Median

The median is the "middle value" that divides ordered data into two equal-sized halves.

More precisely:

-   If n is odd: The median is the middle observation (the one at position (n+1)/2)
-   If n is even: The median is the average of the two middle observations (at positions n/2 and n/2 + 1)

**Manual Calculation Example:**

Using the same dataset: 2, 4, 4, 5, 5, 7, 9

| Step | Description           | Result              |
|------|-----------------------|---------------------|
| 1    | Order the data        | 2, 4, 4, 5, 5, 7, 9 |
| 2    | Find the middle value | 5                   |

For even number of values, take the average of the two middle values.

**R calculation:**

```{r}
data <- c(2, 4, 4, 5, 5, 7, 9)
median(data)
median(data_with_outlier)
```

**Pros:**

-   Not affected by extreme outliers
-   Better for skewed distributions

**Cons:**

-   Doesn't use all data points
-   Less useful for further statistical calculations

::: callout-warning
To find the position of the median in a dataset:

1.  First sort the data in ascending order

2.  If n is odd:

    -   Median position = $\frac{n + 1}{2}$

3.  If n is even:

    -   First median position = $\frac{n}{2}$
    -   Second median position = $\frac{n}{2} + 1$
    -   Median = $\frac{\text{value at }\frac{n}{2} + \text{value at }(\frac{n}{2}+1)}{2}$

For example:

-   Odd n=7: position = $\frac{7+1}{2} = 4$th value
-   Even n=8: positions = $\frac{8}{2} = 4$th and $4+1 = 5$th value
:::

### Mode

The mode is the most frequently occurring value.

**Manual Calculation Example:**

Using the dataset: 2, 4, 4, 5, 5, 7, 9

| Value | Frequency |
|-------|-----------|
| 2     | 1         |
| 4     | 2         |
| 5     | 2         |
| 7     | 1         |
| 9     | 1         |

The mode is 4 and 5 (bimodal).

**R calculation:**

```{r}
library(modeest)
mfv(data)  # Most frequent value
```

**Pros:**

-   Only measure of central tendency for nominal data
-   Can identify multiple peaks in the data

**Cons:**

-   Not always uniquely defined
-   Not useful for continuous data

### Weighted (arithmetic) Mean (\*)

The weighted mean is used when some data points are more important than others. There are two types of weighted means: with not normalized weights and with normalized weights.

#### Weighted Mean with Not Normalized Weights

This is the standard form of the weighted mean, where weights can be any positive numbers representing the importance of each data point.

**Formula:** $\bar{x}_w = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n w_i x_i}{\sum_{i=1}^n w_i}$

**Manual Calculation Example:**

Let's calculate the weighted mean for the dataset: 2, 4, 5, 7 with weights 1, 2, 3, 1

| Step | Description | Calculation |
|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| 1 | Multiply each value by its weight | (2 \* 1) + (4 \* 2) + (5 \* 3) + (7 \* 1) = 2 + 8 + 15 + 7 = 32 |
| 2 | Sum the weights | 1 + 2 + 3 + 1 = 7 |
| 3 | Divide the result from step 1 by the result from step 2 | 32 / 7 = 4.57 |

**R calculation:**

```{r}
x <- c(2, 4, 5, 7)
w <- c(1, 2, 3, 1)
weighted.mean(x, w)
```

#### Weighted Mean with Normalized Weights (Fractions)

In this case, the weights are fractions that sum to 1, representing the proportion of importance for each data point.

**Formula:** $\bar{x}_w = \sum_{i=1}^n w_i x_i$, where $\sum_{i=1}^n w_i = 1$

**Manual Calculation Example:**

Let's calculate the weighted mean for the dataset: 2, 4, 5, 7 with normalized weights 0.1, 0.3, 0.4, 0.2

| Step | Description | Calculation |
|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| 1 | Multiply each value by its weight | (2 \* 0.1) + (4 \* 0.3) + (5 \* 0.4) + (7 \* 0.2) |
| 2 | Sum the results | 0.2 + 1.2 + 2.0 + 1.4 = 4.8 |

**R calculation:**

```{r}
x <- c(2, 4, 5, 7)
w_normalized <- c(0.1, 0.3, 0.4, 0.2)  # Note: these sum to 1
sum(x * w_normalized)
```

**Pros of Weighted Means:**

-   Account for varying importance of data points
-   Useful in survey analysis with different sample sizes or importance levels
-   Can adjust for unequal probabilities in sampling designs

**Cons of Weighted Means:**

-   Require justification for weights
-   Can be misused to manipulate results
-   May be less intuitive to interpret than simple arithmetic mean

## Measures of Variability

These measures describe how spread out the data is. They are crucial for understanding the dispersion of data points around the central tendency.

The three dot plots above demonstrate how variance measures the spread of data around a central value:

-   All distributions have the same mean (μ = 10), shown by the dashed line
-   **Low Variance** (σ² = 1): Points cluster tightly around the mean
-   **Medium Variance** (σ² = 4): Points show moderate spread
-   **High Variance** (σ² = 9): Points spread widely around the mean

This visualization shows three normal distributions with the same mean (μ = 10) but different levels of variability:

1.  **Low Variability (σ = 0.5)**
    -   Data points cluster tightly around the mean
    -   The density curve is tall and narrow
    -   Most observations fall within ±0.5 units of the mean
2.  **Medium Variability (σ = 2.0)**
    -   Data points spread out more from the mean
    -   The density curve is lower and wider
    -   Most observations fall within ±2 units of the mean
3.  **High Variability (σ = 4.0)**
    -   Data points spread widely from the mean
    -   The density curve is much flatter and wider
    -   Most observations fall within ±4 units of the mean
:::

### Range

The range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values.

**Formula:** $R = x_{max} - x_{min}$

**Manual Calculation Example:**

Using the dataset: 2, 4, 4, 5, 5, 7, 9

| Step | Description                   | Calculation |
|------|-------------------------------|-------------|
| 1    | Find the maximum value        | 9           |
| 2    | Find the minimum value        | 2           |
| 3    | Subtract minimum from maximum | 9 - 2 = 7   |

**R calculation:**

```{r}
data <- c(2, 4, 4, 5, 5, 7, 9)
range(data)
max(data) - min(data)
```

**Pros:**

-   Simple to calculate and understand
-   Gives an immediate sense of data spread

**Cons:**

-   Extremely sensitive to outliers
-   Doesn't provide information about the distribution between extremes

### Interquartile Range (IQR)

The IQR is the difference between the 75th and 25th percentiles.

**Formula:** $IQR = Q_3 - Q_1$

To find quartiles manually:

1.  For odd number of values:
    -   Q2 (median) is the middle value
    -   Q1 is the median of the lower half (excluding the median of all observations)
    -   Q3 is the median of the upper half (excluding the median of all observations)
2.  For even number of values:
    -   Q2 is the average of the two middle values
    -   Q1 is the median of the lower half (excluding the median of all observations)
    -   Q3 is the median of the upper half (excluding the median of all observations)

**Manual Calculation Example:**

Using the dataset: 2, 4, 4, 5, 5, 7, 9

| Step | Description                    | Calculation         |
|------|--------------------------------|---------------------|
| 1    | Order the data                 | 2, 4, 4, 5, 5, 7, 9 |
| 2    | Find Q2 (median)               | 5                   |
| 3    | Find Q1 (median of lower half) | 4                   |
| 4    | Find Q3 (median of upper half) | 7                   |
| 5    | Calculate IQR                  | Q3 - Q1 = 7 - 4 = 3 |

**R calculation:**

```{r}
data <- c(2, 4, 4, 5, 5, 7, 9)
print(data)
quantile(data, type = 1)
IQR(data, type = 1)
```

**Pros:**

-   Robust to outliers
-   Provides information about the spread of the middle 50% of the data

**Cons:**

-   Ignores the tails of the distribution
-   Less efficient than standard deviation for normal distributions

### Variance

Variance measures the average squared deviation from the mean.

**Formula:** $s^2 = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \bar{x})^2}{n - 1}$

::: callout-note
#### Variance: Understanding Average Squared Deviations

**What is Variance?** Variance measures how "spread out" numbers are from their mean - it's the average of squared deviations from the mean.

Formula: $s^2 = \frac{\sum(x_i - \bar{x})^2}{n-1}$

**Simple Example:** Consider numbers: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 Mean ($\bar{x}$) = 6

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| fig.height: 4
#| fig.width: 6
library(ggplot2)

# Data
df <- data.frame(
  x = 1:5,
  values = c(2, 4, 6, 8, 10)
)

# Plot
ggplot(df, aes(x = x, y = values)) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 6, color = "blue", linetype = "dashed") +
  geom_point(size = 3) +
  geom_segment(aes(xend = x, yend = 6), color = "red", linetype = "dotted") +
  labs(title = "Deviations from Mean",
       x = "Position",
       y = "Value") +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 12)) +
  theme_minimal()
```

**Calculating Deviations:**

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| fig.height: 4
#| fig.width: 6
# Squared deviations data
df$sq_dev <- (df$values - 6)^2

ggplot(df, aes(x = x, y = sq_dev)) +
  geom_col(fill = "skyblue") +
  labs(title = "Squared Deviations",
       x = "Position",
       y = "Squared Deviation") +
  theme_minimal()
```

| Value | Deviation from mean | Square of deviation |
|-------|---------------------|---------------------|
| 2     | -4                  | 16                  |
| 4     | -2                  | 4                   |
| 6     | 0                   | 0                   |
| 8     | +2                  | 4                   |
| 10    | +4                  | 16                  |

Variance = $\frac{16 + 4 + 0 + 4 + 16}{4} = 10$

**Key Points:**

1.  Mean acts as a reference line (blue dashed line)
2.  Deviations show distance from mean (red dotted lines)
3.  Squaring makes all deviations positive (blue bars)
4.  Larger deviations contribute more to variance
:::

**Manual Calculation Example:**

Using the dataset: 2, 4, 4, 5, 5, 7, 9

| Step | Description | Calculation |
|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| 1 | Calculate the mean | $\bar{x} = 5.14$ |
| 2 | Subtract the mean from each value and square the result | $(2 - 5.14)^2 = 9.86$ |
|  |  | $(4 - 5.14)^2 = 1.30$ |
|  |  | $(4 - 5.14)^2 = 1.30$ |
|  |  | $(5 - 5.14)^2 = 0.02$ |
|  |  | $(5 - 5.14)^2 = 0.02$ |
|  |  | $(7 - 5.14)^2 = 3.46$ |
|  |  | $(9 - 5.14)^2 = 14.90$ |
| 3 | Sum the squared differences | 30.86 |
| 4 | Divide by (n-1), i.e. by the number of observations - 1 | 30.86 / 6 = 5.14 |

**R calculation:**

```{r}
var(data)
```

**Pros:**

-   Uses all data points
-   Foundation for many statistical tests

**Cons:**

-   Units are squared, making interpretation less intuitive
-   Sensitive to outliers

::: callout-important
#### Bessel's Correction: Why We Divide by (n-1) And Not by n

**The Key Insight:**

When we calculate deviations from the mean, they must sum to zero. This is a mathematical fact: $\sum(x_i - \bar{x}) = 0$

**Think of it Like This:**

If you have 5 numbers and their mean:

-   Once you calculate 4 deviations from the mean
-   The 5th deviation MUST be whatever makes the sum zero
-   You don't really have 5 independent deviations
-   You only have 4 truly "free" deviations

**Simple Example:**

Numbers: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10

-   Mean = 6
-   Deviations: -4, -2, 0, +2, +4
-   Notice they sum to zero
-   If you know any 4 deviations, the 5th is predetermined!

**This is Why:**

-   When calculating variance: $s^2 = \frac{\sum(x_i - \bar{x})^2}{n-1}$
-   We divide by (n-1) not n
-   Because only (n-1) deviations are truly independent
-   The last one is determined by the others

**Degrees of Freedom:**

-   n = number of observations
-   1 = constraint (deviations must sum to zero)
-   n-1 = degrees of freedom = number of truly independent deviations

**When to Use It:**

-   When calculating sample variance
-   When calculating sample standard deviation

**When NOT to Use It:**

-   Population calculations (when you have all data)

**Remember:**

-   It's not just a statistical trick
-   Deviations from the mean must sum to zero
-   This constraint costs us one degree of freedom
:::

### Standard Deviation

The standard deviation is the square root of the variance and measures the average dispersion of the data about their arithmetic mean. In contrast to the variance, it has the advantage of being expressed in the same units as the original measurements, making its interpretation more intuitive.

**Formula:** $s = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \bar{x})^2}{n - 1}}$

**Manual Calculation Example:**

Using the dataset: 2, 4, 4, 5, 5, 7, 9

| Step | Description            | Calculation                              |
|------|------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| 1    | Calculate the variance | $s^2 = 5.14$ (from previous calculation) |
| 2    | Take the square root   | $s = \sqrt{5.14} = 2.27$                 |

**R calculation:**

```{r}
sd(data)
```

**Pros:**

-   In same units as original data
-   Widely used and understood

**Cons:**

-   Still sensitive to outliers
-   Assumes data is roughly "normally" distributed

### Coefficient of Variation (\*)

The coefficient of variation is the standard deviation divided by the mean, often expressed as a percentage.

**Formula:** $CV = \frac{s}{\bar{x}} \times 100\%$

**Manual Calculation Example:**

Using the dataset: 2, 4, 4, 5, 5, 7, 9

| Step | Description | Calculation |
|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| 1 | Calculate the mean | $\bar{x} = 5.14$ |
| 2 | Calculate the standard deviation | $s = 2.27$ |
| 3 | Divide s by the mean and multiply by 100 | $(2.27 / 5.14) * 100 = 44.16\%$ |

**R calculation:**

```{r}
(sd(data) / mean(data)) * 100
```

**Pros:**

-   Allows comparison of variability between datasets with different units or means
-   Useful in fields like finance for risk assessment

**Cons:**

-   Not meaningful for data with both positive and negative values
-   Can be misleading when mean is close to zero

::: callout-warning
### Limitations of Coefficient of Variation (CV)

The coefficient of variation, calculated as $(σ/μ) × 100\%$, has two important limitations:

#### Not meaningful for data with both positive and negative values

-   The mean could be close to zero due to positive and negative values cancelling out
-   Example: Dataset {-5, -3, 2, 6} has mean = 0
    -   CV = (std dev / 0) × 100%
    -   This leads to division by zero
    -   Even if mean isn't exactly zero, the CV doesn't represent true relative variability when data cross zero
-   The CV assumes a natural zero point and meaningful ratios between values

#### Misleading when mean is close to zero

-   Since CV = $(σ/μ) × 100\%$, as $μ$ approaches zero:
    -   The denominator becomes very small
    -   Results in extremely large CV values
    -   These large values don't meaningfully represent relative variability
-   Example:
    -   Dataset A: {0.001, 0.002, 0.003} has mean = 0.002
    -   Even small standard deviations will produce very large CVs
    -   The resulting large CV might suggest extreme variability when the data are actually quite close together

#### Best Use Cases

CV is most useful for:

-   Strictly positive data
-   Data measured on a ratio scale
-   Data with means well above zero
-   Comparing variability between datasets with different units or scales
:::

## Measures of Relative Position (Standing)

Understanding where values sit within a dataset is crucial for data analysis. Let's explore these concepts step by step.

### Quartiles (Q): The Basics

Think of quartiles as special numbers that split your ordered data into four equal parts.

![Doane, D. P., & Seward, L. W. (2016). Applied statistics in business and economics. Mcgraw-Hill.](stat_imgs/IMG_4327.jpg)

#### What Are Quartiles?

First Quartile (Q1):

-   Separates the lowest 25% of data from the rest
-   Also called the 25th percentile
-   Example: If Q1 = 50 in a test score dataset, 25% of students scored below 50

Second Quartile (Q2):

-   The median - splits data in half
-   Also called the 50th percentile
-   Example: If Q2 = 70, half the students scored below 70

Third Quartile (Q3):

-   Separates the highest 25% of data from the rest
-   Also called the 75th percentile
-   Example: If Q3 = 85, 75% of students scored below 85

#### How to Calculate Quartiles (Step by Step) - Two Methods

Let's examine student test scores using both common quartile calculation methods:

**Example 1: Odd Number Case (11 scores)**\
60, 65, 70, 72, 75, 78, 80, 82, 85, 88, 90

Step 1: Find Q2 (median) - Same for both methods

-   With n = 11 values (odd)
-   Median position = (n + 1)/2 = 6
-   Q2 = 78

Step 2: Find Q1

-   Tukey's Method:
    -   Look at lower half: 60, 65, 70, 72, 75
    -   Q1 = median of lower half = 70
-   Interpolation Method:
    -   Position = (n + 1)/4 = (11 + 1)/4 = 3
    -   Q1 = 70 (3rd value)

Step 3: Find Q3

-   Tukey's Method:
    -   Look at upper half: 80, 82, 85, 88, 90
    -   Q3 = median of upper half = 85
-   Interpolation Method:
    -   Position = 3(n + 1)/4 = 3(12)/4 = 9
    -   Q3 = 85 (9th value)

**Example 2: Even Number Case (10 scores)**\
60, 65, 70, 72, 75, 78, 80, 82, 85, 90

Step 1: Find Q2 (median) - Same for both methods

-   With n = 10 values (even)
-   Median positions = 5 and 6
-   Q2 = (75 + 78)/2 = 76.5

Step 2: Find Q1

-   Tukey's Method:
    -   Look at lower half: 60, 65, 70, 72, 75
    -   Q1 = median of lower half = 70
-   Interpolation Method:
    -   Position = (10 + 1)/4 = 2.75
    -   Q1 = 65 + 0.75(70 - 65) = 68.75

Step 3: Find Q3

-   Tukey's Method:
    -   Look at upper half: 78, 80, 82, 85, 90
    -   Q3 = median of upper half = 82
-   Interpolation Method:
    -   Position = 3(10 + 1)/4 = 8.25
    -   Q3 = 82 + 0.25(85 - 82) = 82.75

Important Notes:

1.  Tukey's Method:

    -   First find the median (Q2)
    -   Split the data into lower and upper halves
    -   Find Q1 as the median of the lower half
    -   Find Q3 as the median of the upper half
    -   When n is odd, the median is not included in either half

2.  Interpolation Method:

    -   Uses positions (n+1)/4 for Q1 and 3(n+1)/4 for Q3
    -   When position falls between values, uses linear interpolation
    -   Doesn't require splitting data into halves

Both methods give the same results for simple positions (Example 1) but can differ when interpolation is needed (Example 2).

## Manual Construction of Tukey Boxplot

**Step 1: Calculate Key Components**

1.  Find quartiles: $Q_1$, $Q_2$ (median), $Q_3$
2.  Calculate Interquartile Range: $IQR = Q_3 - Q_1$

**Step 2: Determine Whisker Boundaries**

-   Lower fence: $Q_1 - 1.5 \times IQR$
-   Upper fence: $Q_3 + 1.5 \times IQR$

**Step 3: Identify Outliers** Data points are outliers if they are:

-   Below lower fence: $x < Q_1 - 1.5 \times IQR$
-   Above upper fence: $x > Q_3 + 1.5 \times IQR$

**Example:** Given data: 2, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 16, 50

1.  Find quartiles:

    -   $Q_1 = 6$
    -   $Q_2 = 10$
    -   $Q_3 = 14$

2.  Calculate $IQR$:

    -   $IQR = 14 - 6 = 8$

3.  Calculate fences:

    -   Lower: $6 - (1.5 \times 8) = -6$
    -   Upper: $14 + (1.5 \times 8) = 26$

4.  Identify outliers:

    -   50 \> 26, therefore 50 is an outlier

**Graphical Elements:**

1.  Box: Draw from $Q_1$ to $Q_3$
2.  Line inside box: Draw at $Q_2$
3.  Whiskers: Extend to most extreme non-outlier points
4.  Points: Plot outliers individually beyond whiskers

### Percentiles: A More Precise Measure of Relative Standing (\*)

#### What Are Percentiles?

Percentiles give us a more detailed view by dividing data into 100 equal parts.

Key Points:

-   The 25th percentile equals Q1
-   The 50th percentile equals Q2 (median)
-   The 75th percentile equals Q3

#### Calculating Percentiles

The Formula: $P_k = \frac{k(n+1)}{100}$

Where:

-   $P_k$ is the position for the kth percentile
-   k is the percentile we want (1-100)
-   n is the number of observations

**Example 3: Finding the 60th Percentile** Let's use student homework scores: 72, 75, 78, 80, 82, 85, 88, 90, 92, 95

Step 1: Calculate position

-   n = 10 scores
-   For 60th percentile: $P_{60} = \frac{60(10+1)}{100} = 6.6$

Step 2: Find surrounding values

-   Position 6: score of 85
-   Position 7: score of 88

Step 3: Interpolate (important: percentiles use linear interpolation)

-   We need to go 0.6 of the way between 85 and 88 $P_{60} = 85 + 0.6(88-85)$ $P_{60} = 85 + 0.6(3)$ $P_{60} = 85 + 1.8 = 86.8$

What this means: 60% of students scored 86.8 or below.

### Percentile Ranks (PR) (\*)

#### What is a Percentile Rank?

Percentiles and percentile ranks are related but opposite concepts:

**Key Difference:** - **Percentile** → "What score is at the 75th percentile?" (position → value) - **Percentile Rank** → "What percentile rank does a score of 75 have?" (value → position)

**Percentile rank** tells us what percentage of values fall below a specific score. Think of it as answering: *"What percentage of the class did I score higher than?"*

#### The Formula

$$
PR = \frac{\text{number of values below} + 0.5 \times \text{number of equal values}}{\text{total number of values}} \times 100
$$

#### Example 4: Finding a Percentile Rank

Consider these exam scores (sorted):

| Position | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4      | 5      | 6      | 7   | 8   | 9   | 10  |
|----------|-----|-----|-----|--------|--------|--------|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| Score    | 65  | 70  | 70  | **75** | **75** | **75** | 80  | 85  | 85  | 90  |

Let's find the PR for a score of **75** (highlighted).

**Step 1: Count carefully** - Values **below** 75: 65, 70, 70 → **3 values** - Values **equal to** 75: 75, 75, 75 → **3 values** - Total values: **10**

**Step 2: Apply the formula**

$$
PR = \frac{3 + 0.5(3)}{10} \times 100 = \frac{3 + 1.5}{10} \times 100 = \frac{4.5}{10} \times 100 = 45\%
$$

**Interpretation:** A score of 75 is higher than 45% of the class scores.

**Sanity check:** This makes sense! There are 3 scores clearly below 75, and you're in the middle of the 3 people who scored 75, so you're at roughly position 4.5 out of 10 = 45%. ✓

#### Understanding the 0.5 Factor

**Q: Why do we multiply equal values by 0.5?**

**A:** The 0.5 factor means we count **half** of the tied values as being below us.

Here's the intuition: If you scored 75 along with two other people, should you count yourself as: - Above all of them? (That wouldn't be fair to them) - Below all of them? (That wouldn't be fair to you) - Somewhere in the middle? ✓ (This is the fairest approach)

**Using our example:** - 3 people scored below 75: we count all **3** of them - 3 people scored exactly 75 (including you): we count **half** of them = 0.5 × 3 = **1.5** - Total below or tied: 3 + 1.5 = 4.5 out of 10 = 45%

By using 0.5, we're essentially saying: *"Of the people who tied with me, I can assume I did better than half of them."* This treats everyone with the same score equally and avoids giving any one person an unfair advantage.

#### Practice Problem

Using the same dataset above, find the percentile rank for a score of **85**.

<details>

<summary>Click to see the solution</summary>

**Counting:** - Values below 85: 65, 70, 70, 75, 75, 75, 80 → 7 values - Values equal to 85: 85, 85 → 2 values - Total: 10 values

**Calculation:** $$
PR = \frac{7 + 0.5(2)}{10} \times 100 = \frac{8}{10} \times 100 = 80\%
$$

**Answer:** A score of 85 has a percentile rank of 80%.

</details>

#### Note on Software Implementation

Different software packages may use slightly different methods for calculating percentile ranks: - **R**: Use `ecdf()` function or manually calculate - **Python (pandas)**: Use `rank(pct=True)` method

These may produce slightly different results depending on how they handle ties and boundary cases.

Box plots (also known as box-and-whisker plots) are powerful visualization tools for understanding data distributions. In this section, we'll explore how to construct and interpret box plots using height measurements from two groups.

#### Construction of the Tukey Box Plot {#sec-boxplot-construction}

The box plot was introduced by John Tukey as part of his exploratory data analysis toolkit. It provides a standardized way of displaying the distribution of data based on a five-number summary.

##### The Five-Number Summary

A box plot represents five key statistical values:

1.  **Minimum**: The smallest value in the dataset (excluding outliers)
2.  **First Quartile (Q1)**: The 25th percentile, below which 25% of observations fall
3.  **Median (Q2)**: The 50th percentile, which divides the dataset into two equal halves
4.  **Third Quartile (Q3)**: The 75th percentile, below which 75% of observations fall
5.  **Maximum**: The largest value in the dataset (excluding outliers)

##### Box Plot Components

```{r}
#| label: fig-boxplot-diagram
#| echo: false
#| fig.cap: "Boxplot diagram showing its key components."
#| fig.height: 4
#| fig.width: 8
# Create sample data
set.seed(123)
sample_data <- c(rnorm(100, 10, 2), 2, 18, 19)
# Create data frame
df <- data.frame(value = sample_data)

# Calculate statistical values
q1 <- quantile(sample_data, 0.25)
q3 <- quantile(sample_data, 0.75)
iqr_val <- IQR(sample_data)
lower_bound <- max(min(sample_data), q1 - 1.5 * iqr_val)
upper_bound <- min(max(sample_data), q3 + 1.5 * iqr_val)
med <- median(sample_data)

# Create boxplot with annotations
p <- ggplot(df, aes(x = factor(1), y = value)) +
  geom_boxplot(width = 0.4, outlier.shape = 8, outlier.size = 3) +
  theme_minimal() +

        axis.text.x = element_blank(),
        axis.ticks.x = element_blank(),

  ylab("Value") +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0.7, 2.5)) +  # Extend plot area for text
  
  # Text labels on the right with proper spacing
  annotate("text", x = 1.4, y = med, label = "Median (Q2)", hjust = 0) +
  annotate("text", x = 1.4, y = q1, label = "First quartile (Q1)", hjust = 0) +
  annotate("text", x = 1.4, y = q3, label = "Third quartile (Q3)", hjust = 0) +
  
  # Proper offsets for min/max values
  annotate("text", x = 1.4, y = lower_bound - 0.3, 
           label = "Minimum (within 1.5*IQR)", hjust = 0) +
  annotate("text", x = 1.4, y = upper_bound + 0.3, 
           label = "Maximum (within 1.5*IQR)", hjust = 0) +
  
  # Outlier labels with offsets
  annotate("text", x = 1.4, y = min(sample_data) - 0.3, label = "Outlier", hjust = 0) +
  annotate("text", x = 1.4, y = max(sample_data) + 0.3, label = "Outlier", hjust = 0) +
  
  # IQR marking on the left side
  annotate("segment", x = 0.8, xend = 0.8, y = q1, yend = q3,
           arrow = arrow(ends = "both", length = unit(0.1, "inches")), color = "blue") +
  annotate("text", x = 0.65, y = (q1 + q3)/2, label = "IQR", color = "blue")

```

The components of a box plot include:

1.  **The Box**:
    -   Represents the interquartile range (IQR), containing the middle 50% of the data
    -   Lower edge represents Q1
    -   Upper edge represents Q3
    -   Line inside the box represents the median (Q2)
2.  **The Whiskers**:
    -   Extend from the box to show the range of non-outlier data
    -   In a Tukey box plot, whiskers extend up to 1.5 × IQR from the box edges:
        -   Lower whisker: extends to the minimum value ≥ (Q1 - 1.5 × IQR)
        -   Upper whisker: extends to the maximum value ≤ (Q3 + 1.5 × IQR)
3.  **Outliers**:
    -   Points that fall beyond the whiskers
    -   Individually plotted as dots or symbols
    -   Values that are \< (Q1 - 1.5 × IQR) or \> (Q3 + 1.5 × IQR)

##### Key Features to Observe

When interpreting box plots, look for these characteristics:

1.  **Central Tendency**: Location of the median line within the box
2.  **Dispersion**: Width of the box (IQR) and length of the whiskers
3.  **Skewness**:
    -   Symmetrical data: median is approximately in the middle of the box, whiskers are roughly equal in length
    -   Right (positive) skew: median is closer to the bottom of the box, upper whisker is longer
    -   Left (negative) skew: median is closer to the top of the box, lower whisker is longer
4.  **Outliers**: Presence of individual points beyond the whiskers

#### Case Study: Comparing Heights Between Groups {#sec-height-comparison}

Let's apply our understanding of box plots to a real dataset. We have height measurements (in centimeters) from two groups of 25 students each.

```{r}
#| label: height-data
#| echo: true

# Create the dataset
data_height <- data.frame(
  group_1 = c(150, 160, 165, 168, 172, 173, 175, 176, 177, 178, 179, 180, 180, 181, 181, 182, 182, 183, 183, 184, 186, 188, 190, 191, 200),
  group_2 = c(138, 140, 148, 152, 164, 164, 165, 165, 166, 166, 170, 175, 175, 175, 182, 182, 182, 182, 182, 182, 183, 183, 183, 188, 210)
)

# Transform dataset from wide to long format
data_height_l <- gather(data = data_height, key = "Group_number", value = "height", group_1:group_2)

# Display the first few rows
head(data_height_l)
```

Let's calculate some summary statistics for each group:

```{r}
#| label: summary-stats
#| echo: true

# Calculate summary statistics for each group
group1_stats <- summary(data_height$group_1)
group2_stats <- summary(data_height$group_2)

# Calculate IQR
group1_iqr <- IQR(data_height$group_1)
group2_iqr <- IQR(data_height$group_2)

# Create a comparison table
stats_table <- rbind(
  group1_stats,
  group2_stats
)
rownames(stats_table) <- c("Group 1", "Group 2")

# Display the table
stats_table

# Display IQR values
cat("IQR for Group 1:", group1_iqr, "\n")
cat("IQR for Group 2:", group2_iqr, "\n")
```

#### Visualizing the Height Data {#sec-visualizing-heights}

Now, let's visualize the data using box plots and density plots:

```{r}
#| label: fig-boxplots
#| fig.cap: "Box plots comparing height distributions between groups."
#| fig.width: 8
#| fig.height: 4

# Create horizontal boxplots
ggplot(data = data_height_l) + 
  geom_boxplot(aes(x = Group_number, y = height, colour = Group_number), notch = FALSE) + 
  coord_flip() + 
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(130, 210, 5)) + 
  theme_pubr() + 
  grids(linetype = "dashed") +
  labs(title = "Height Distribution by Group",
       x = "Group",
       y = "Height (cm)")

```

To complement our box plots, let's also look at the density distributions:

```{r}
#| label: fig-density
#| fig.cap: "Density plots showing the height distributions for each group."
#| fig.width: 8
#| fig.height: 4

# Create density plots
ggplot(data = data_height_l) + 
  geom_density(aes(x = height, fill = Group_number), alpha = 0.5) + 
  facet_grid(~ Group_number) + 
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(130, 210, 10)) +
  labs(title = "Height Density by Group",
       x = "Height (cm)",
       y = "Density")
```

#### Box Plot Interpretation Exercise {#sec-boxplot-exercise}

:::

Let's review the answers to our box plot interpretation questions:

::: {.callout-important collapse="true"}
#### Solutions

1.  Students from G2 are, on average, taller than G1: **False**
    -   Explanation: The median height (middle line in the boxplot) for G1 is higher than G2.
2.  G1 height is more dispersed/spread out: **False**
    -   Explanation: G2 shows greater dispersion. This is visible in the boxplot where G2 has a larger interquartile range (IQR) of 17.5 cm compared to G1's 9.5 cm. G2 also has a wider range from minimum to maximum values.
3.  The lowest person is in G2: **True**
    -   Explanation: The minimum value in G2 is 138 cm, which is lower than the minimum value in G1 (150 cm).
4.  Both data sets are negatively (left) skewed: **True**
    -   Explanation: In both groups, the median line is positioned toward the upper part of the box, and the lower whisker is longer than the upper whisker. This indicates that there's a longer tail on the left side of the distribution, which means negative skewness.
5.  Half of G2 measure at least 175 cm: **True**
    -   Explanation: The median (middle line in the boxplot) for G2 is 175 cm, which means that 50% of the values are greater than or equal to 175 cm.

## Shape Measures (\*)

### Skewness

**What it measures:** The asymmetry of your data distribution. Think of it as answering "which tail is longer?"

**Formula:**

$SK = \frac{n}{(n-1)(n-2)} \sum_{i=1}^n \left(\frac{x_i - \bar{x}}{s}\right)^3$

**Quick interpretation:**

-   **SK \> 0**: Right tail is longer (most data on the left, few high outliers)
-   **SK \< 0**: Left tail is longer (most data on the right, few low outliers)\
-   **SK ≈ 0**: Roughly symmetric

#### Clear Visualization of Skewness

### Kurtosis

**What it measures:** The "tailedness" of your distribution. Think of it as answering "how extreme are the extremes?"

**Formula:**

$K = \frac{n(n+1)}{(n-1)(n-2)(n-3)} \sum_{i=1}^n \left(\frac{x_i - \bar{x}}{s}\right)^4 - \frac{3(n-1)^2}{(n-2)(n-3)}$

**Quick interpretation:**

-   **K \> 3** (Leptokurtic): Heavy tails, sharp peak (more extreme values)
-   **K \< 3** (Platykurtic): Light tails, flat peak (fewer extreme values)
-   **K ≈ 3** (Mesokurtic): Normal-like behavior

#### Visualization of Kurtosis

```{r}
set.seed(789)

# Generate VERY clear examples - all centered at 0 with sd ≈ 1
n <- 8000

# EXTREME heavy tails: mixture of tight center + extreme outliers
heavy_tails <- c(rnorm(7000, 0, 0.5),    # Very tight center (sharp peak)
                 rnorm(1000, 0, 4))       # Many extreme outliers

# Light tails: uniform distribution (no outliers possible)
light_tails <- runif(n, -1.73, 1.73)  # Scaled to sd ≈ 1

# Normal: reference distribution
normal_tails <- rnorm(n, 0, 1)

### Key Takeaways

**Skewness tells you about asymmetry:**

-   Positive: Long right tail → Mean pulled above median
-   Negative: Long left tail → Mean pulled below median

**Kurtosis tells you about extremes:**

-   High kurtosis (K \> 5): Expect frequent outliers - "black swan" events
-   Low kurtosis (K \< 2): Data stays predictable, within tight bounds
-   Normal kurtosis (K ≈ 3): Typical bell curve behavior

**Visual cues:**

-   **Skewness**: Look at tail length - mean vs median separation
-   **Kurtosis**: Look at peak sharpness AND tail thickness simultaneously

**Practical meaning:**

-   High kurtosis ≠ just "fat tails" - it's a sharp peak WITH heavy tails
-   It means: "mostly clustered, but watch out for surprises"

## Exercise 1. Center and dispersion of data

### Data

We have salary data (in thousands of euros) from two small European companies:

| Index | Company X | Company Y |
|-------|-----------|-----------|
| 1     | 2         | 3         |
| 2     | 2         | 3         |
| 3     | 2         | 4         |
| 4     | 3         | 4         |
| 5     | 3         | 4         |
| 6     | 3         | 4         |

This table presents the data for both Company X and Company Y side by side, with an index column for easy reference.

### Measures of Central Tendency

#### Mean

The mean is the average of all values in a dataset.

Formula: $\bar{x} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i}{n}$

Można też zapisać ten wzór w postaci:

$\bar{x} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{k} x_i f_i}{n}$

gdzie $f_i$ to częstość bezwzględna (liczba wystąpień, waga bezwzględna) $i$-tej wartości, a $k$ to liczba różnych wartości cechy (liczba wartości wyróżnionych).

Z użyciem częstości względnych:

$\bar{x} = \sum_{i=1}^{k} x_i p_i$

gdzie $p_i$ to częstość względna (frakcja, waga znormalizowana) $i$-tej wartości, a $k$ to liczba różnych wartości cechy (liczba wartości wyróżnionych).

##### Manual Calculation for Company X

| Value ($x_i$) | Frequency ($f_i$) | $x_i \cdot f_i$ |
|---------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| 2             | 3                 | 6               |
| 3             | 6                 | 18              |
| 4             | 5                 | 20              |
| 5             | 4                 | 20              |
| 20            | 1                 | 20              |
| 35            | 1                 | 35              |
| Total         | n = 20            | Sum = 119       |

$\bar{x} = \frac{119}{20} = 5.95$

##### Manual Calculation for Company Y

| Value ($x_i$) | Frequency ($f_i$) | $x_i \cdot f_i$ |
|---------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| 3             | 2                 | 6               |
| 4             | 6                 | 24              |
| 5             | 6                 | 30              |
| 6             | 3                 | 18              |
| 7             | 2                 | 14              |
| 8             | 1                 | 8               |
| Total         | n = 20            | Sum = 100       |

$\bar{y} = \frac{100}{20} = 5$

##### R Verification

```{r}
X <- c(2,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,4,4,4,4,4,5,5,5,5,20,35)
Y <- c(3,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,5,5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,7,7,8)

mean(X)
mean(Y)
```

#### Median

The median is the middle value when the data is ordered.

##### Manual Calculation for Company X

Ordered data: \[2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 20, 35\]

n = 20 (even), so we take the average of the 10th and 11th values:

Median = $\frac{4 + 4}{2} = 4$

##### Manual Calculation for Company Y

Ordered data: \[3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6, 7, 7, 8\]

n = 20 (even), so we take the average of the 10th and 11th values:

Median = $\frac{5 + 5}{2} = 5$

##### R Verification

```{r}
median(X)
median(Y)
```

#### Mode

The mode is the most frequent value in the dataset.

For Company X, the mode is 3 (appears 6 times). For Company Y, there are two modes: 4 and 5 (both appear 6 times).

```{r}
# Function to calculate mode
get_mode <- function(x) {
  unique_x <- unique(x)
  unique_x[which.max(tabulate(match(x, unique_x)))]
}

get_mode(X)
get_mode(Y)
```

### Measures of Dispersion

#### Variance

The variance measures the average squared deviation from the mean.

Formula: $s^2 = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \bar{x})^2}{n-1}$

Poprawka Bessela jest stosowana przy obliczaniu wariancji z próby, aby uzyskać nieobciążony estymator wariancji populacji. W standardowym wzorze na wariancję z próby dzielimy przez $(n-1)$ zamiast przez $n$.

**Modyfikacje wzoru dla danych pogrupowanych (szereg częstości):**

Można też zapisać ten wzór w postaci:

$$s^2 = \frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^{k} f_i(x_i - \bar{x})^2$$

gdzie $f_i$ to częstość bezwzględna (liczba wystąpień) $i$-tej wartości.

Gdy w obliczeniach stosujemy częstości względne $p = f_i/n$, gdzie:

-   $f_i$ to częstość (liczba wystąpień)
-   $n$ to całkowita liczebność próby

Wzór na wariancję z uwzględnieniem poprawki Bessela przyjmuje postać:

$$s^2 = \frac{n}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^{k} p_i(x_i - \bar{x})^2$$

gdzie:

-   $s^2$ to wariancja z próby
-   $n$ to liczebność próby
-   $p_i$ to częstość względna $i$-tej wartości
-   $x_i$ to $i$-ta wartość cechy
-   $\bar{x}$ to średnia arytmetyczna
-   $k$ to liczba różnych wartości cechy

Kluczowe jest to, że przy stosowaniu częstości względnych mnożymy całe wyrażenie przez czynnik $\frac{n}{n-1}$, który wprowadza poprawkę Bessela.

##### R Verification

#### Standard Deviation

The standard deviation is the square root of the variance.

Formula: $s = \sqrt{s^2}$

-   For Company X: $s = \sqrt{61.21} = 7.82$
-   For Company Y: $s = \sqrt{1.79} = 1.34$

##### R Verification

```{r}

Ordered data: \[3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6, 7, 7, 8\]

-   Q1 (25th percentile): median of first 10 numbers = 4
-   Q2 (50th percentile, median): 5
-   Q3 (75th percentile): median of last 10 numbers = 6

#### R Verification

```{r}
quantile(X)
quantile(Y)
```

#### IQR

-   $IQR_x = 5 - 3 = 2$
-   $IQR_y = 6 - 4 = 2$

### Tukey Box Plot

A Tukey box plot visually represents the distribution of data based on quartiles. We'll use ggplot2 to create the plot.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyr)

# Prepare the data
data <- data.frame(
  Company = rep(c("X", "Y"), each = 20),
  Salary = c(X, Y)
)

# Create the box plot
ggplot(data, aes(x = Company, y = Salary, fill = Company)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "Salary Distribution in Companies X and Y",
       x = "Company",
       y = "Salary (thousands of euros)") +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("X" = "#69b3a2", "Y" = "#404080"))

# Create the box plot
ggplot(data, aes(x = Company, y = Salary, fill = Company)) +
  geom_boxplot(outliers = F) +
  labs(title = "Salary Distribution in Companies X and Y",
       x = "Company",
       y = "Salary (thousands of euros)") +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("X" = "#69b3a2", "Y" = "#404080"))
```

#### Interpreting the Box Plot

1.  The box represents the interquartile range (IQR) from Q1 to Q3.
2.  The line inside the box is the median (Q2).
3.  Whiskers extend to the smallest and largest values within 1.5 \* IQR.
4.  Points beyond the whiskers are considered outliers.

### Comparison of Results

| Measure            | Company X | Company Y |
|--------------------|-----------|-----------|
| Mean               | 5.95      | 5.00      |
| Median             | 4         | 5         |
| Mode               | 3         | 4 and 5   |
| Variance           | 61.21     | 1.79      |
| Standard Deviation | 7.82      | 1.34      |
| Q1                 | 3         | 4         |
| Q3                 | 5         | 6         |

#### Key Observations:

1.  Central Tendency: Company X has a higher mean but lower median than Company Y, indicating a right-skewed distribution for Company X.
2.  Dispersion: Company X shows much higher variance and standard deviation, suggesting greater salary disparities.
3.  Distribution Shape: Company Y's salaries are more tightly clustered, while Company X has extreme values (potential outliers) that significantly affect its mean and variance.
4.  Quartiles: Company Y's interquartile range (Q3 - Q1) is slightly larger, but its overall range is much smaller than Company X's.

```

### Data

We have electoral district size data from two countries:

```{r data}
x <- c(1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19)  # Country high variance
y <- c(8, 9, 9, 10, 10, 11, 11, 12, 12, 13)  # Country low variance

kable(data.frame(
  "Country X (High var.)" = x,
  "Country Y (Low var.)" = y
))
```

```

#### Variance

Variance measures the average squared deviation from the mean.

Formula: $s^2 = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \bar{x})^2}{n-1}$

##### Calculations for Country X

| $x_i$ | $(x_i - \bar{x})$ | $(x_i - \bar{x})^2$ |
|-------|-------------------|---------------------|
| 1     | -9                | 81                  |

| Sum   |                   | 330                 |

$s^2_X = \frac{330}{9} = 36.67$

```{r var-x}
var_x <- var(x)
c("Manual" = 36.67, "R" = var_x)
```

##### Calculations for Country Y

| $x_i$ | $(y_i - \bar{y})$ | $(y_i - \bar{y})^2$ |
|-------|-------------------|---------------------|

| Sum   |                   | 22.5                |

$s^2_Y = \frac{22.5}{9} = 2.5$

```{r var-y}
var_y <- var(y)
c("Manual" = 2.5, "R" = var_y)
```

#### Standard Deviation

Standard deviation is the square root of variance. It measures variability in the same units as the data.

Formula: $s = \sqrt{s^2}$

##### Calculations for Country X

Using previously calculated variance: $s^2_X = 36.67$

Calculate square root: $s_X = \sqrt{36.67} \approx 6.06$

| Step            | Calculation    | Result |
|-----------------|----------------|--------|
| 1\. Variance    | $s^2_X$        | 36.67  |
| 2\. Square root | $\sqrt{36.67}$ | 6.06   |

```{r sd-x}
sd_x <- sd(x)
c("Manual" = 6.06, "R" = sd_x)
```

##### Calculations for Country Y

Using previously calculated variance: $s^2_Y = 2.5$

Calculate square root: $s_Y = \sqrt{2.5} \approx 1.58$

| Step            | Calculation  | Result |
|-----------------|--------------|--------|
| 1\. Variance    | $s^2_Y$      | 2.5    |
| 2\. Square root | $\sqrt{2.5}$ | 1.58   |

```{r sd-y}
sd_y <- sd(y)
c("Manual" = 1.58, "R" = sd_y)
```

Interpretation:

-   Country X: Average deviation from the mean is about 6 seats
-   Country Y: Average deviation from the mean is about 1.6 seats

### Coefficient of Variation (CV)

The coefficient of variation is the ratio of standard deviation to mean, expressed as a percentage.

Formula: $CV = \frac{s}{\bar{x}} \times 100\%$

#### Calculations for Country X

$CV_X = \frac{6.06}{10} \times 100\% = 60.6\%$

| Component                | Value |
|--------------------------|-------|
| Standard deviation ($s$) | 6.06  |
| Mean ($\bar{x}$)         | 10    |
| CV                       | 60.6% |

```{r cv-x}
cv_x <- sd(x) / mean(x) * 100
c("Manual" = 60.6, "R" = cv_x)
```

#### Calculations for Country Y

$CV_Y = \frac{1.58}{10.5} \times 100\% = 15.0\%$

| Component                | Value |
|--------------------------|-------|
| Standard deviation ($s$) | 1.58  |
| Mean ($\bar{x}$)         | 10.5  |
| CV                       | 15.0% |

```{r cv-y}
cv_y <- sd(y) / mean(y) * 100
c("Manual" = 15.0, "R" = cv_y)
```

### Quartiles and Interquartile Range (IQR)

#### Methods for Calculating Quartiles

There are different methods for calculating quartiles. In our manual calculations, we'll use the median-excluding method:

1.  Split the series at the median
2.  Median is not included in quartile calculations
3.  Calculate median of each part - these will be Q1 and Q3 respectively

#### Calculations for Country X

Ordered data: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19

Median = 10 (not included in quartile calculations)

Lower half: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 Q1 = median of lower half = 5

Upper half: 11, 13, 15, 17, 19 Q3 = median of upper half = 15

IQR = Q3 - Q1 = 15 - 5 = 10

#### Calculations for Country Y

Ordered data: 8, 9, 9, 10, 10, 11, 11, 12, 12, 13

Median = 10.5 (not included in quartile calculations)

Lower half: 8, 9, 9, 10, 10 Q1 = median of lower half = 9

Upper half: 11, 11, 12, 12, 13 Q3 = median of upper half = 12

IQR = Q3 - Q1 = 12 - 9 = 3

```{r quartiles-comparison}
# Comparison of different quartile calculation methods in R
methods_comparison <- data.frame(
  Method = c("Manual (excl. median)", 
             "R type=1", "R type=2", "R type=7 (default)"),
  "Q1 Country X" = c(5, 
                    quantile(x, 0.25, type=1),
                    quantile(x, 0.25, type=2),
                    quantile(x, 0.25, type=7)),
  "Q3 Country X" = c(15,
                    quantile(x, 0.75, type=1),
                    quantile(x, 0.75, type=2),
                    quantile(x, 0.75, type=7)),
  "Q1 Country Y" = c(9,
                    quantile(y, 0.25, type=1),
                    quantile(y, 0.25, type=2),
                    quantile(y, 0.25, type=7)),
  "Q3 Country Y" = c(12,
                    quantile(y, 0.75, type=1),
                    quantile(y, 0.75, type=2),
                    quantile(y, 0.75, type=7))
)

kable(methods_comparison, digits = 2,
      caption = "Comparison of different quartile calculation methods")
```

#### Explanation of Different Quartile Calculation Methods

1.  **Manual method (excluding median)**:
    -   Splits data into two parts
    -   Excludes median
    -   Finds median of each part
2.  **R type=1**:
    -   First method in R
    -   Uses whole positions
    -   No interpolation
3.  **R type=2**:
    -   Second method in R
    -   Uses whole positions
    -   Interpolates when position is not whole
4.  **R type=7 (default)**:
    -   Default method in R
    -   Uses quantile()\[5\] from SAS
    -   Interpolates according to Hyndman and Fan method

    paste("Q1 =", quantile(y, 0.25, type=1))
  ),
  size = 3
)
```

### Methodological Notes

    -   Always important to specify the method used in reports
2.  **Visualization**:
    -   Box plot effectively shows differences in distributions
    -   Additional points show actual values
    -   Annotations facilitate interpretation

### Application Notes

1.  **Using the Analysis**:
    -   All calculations can be reproduced using the provided R code
    -   Code chunks are self-contained and documented
    -   Data format requirements are clearly specified
2.  **Customization**:
    -   Analysis can be adapted for different district size datasets
    -   Visualization parameters can be adjusted for different presentation needs

3.  **System Design**:

    -   Country X: Flexible, varied approach
    -   Country Y: Standardized, uniform approach
    -   Different philosophical approaches to representation

4.  **Representative Implications**:

    -   Country X: Variable voter-to-representative ratios
    -   Country Y: More consistent representation levels
    -   Different approaches to democratic representation

This analysis demonstrates fundamental differences in electoral system design between the two countries, with Country X adopting a more varied approach and Country Y maintaining greater uniformity in district sizes.

## Exercise 3. Understanding Boxplots Through Life Expectancy Data

```{r}
#| message: false
library(tidyverse)
library(gapminder)

# Prepare data
data_2007 <- gapminder %>%
  filter(year == 2007)
```

## Introduction to Boxplots

A boxplot (also known as a box-and-whisker plot) reveals key statistics about your data:

-   **Median**: The middle line in the box (50th percentile)
-   **First quartile (Q1)**: Bottom of the box (25th percentile)
-   **Third quartile (Q3)**: Top of the box (75th percentile)
-   **Interquartile Range (IQR)**: The height of the box (Q3 - Q1)
-   **Whiskers**: Extend to the most extreme non-outlier values (Tukey's method: 1.5 × IQR)
-   **Outliers**: Individual points beyond the whiskers

### Visualizing Life Expectancy

```{r}
#| fig.height: 16
#| fig.width: 10
ggplot(data_2007, aes(x = reorder(continent, lifeExp, FUN = median), y = lifeExp)) +
  geom_boxplot(fill = "lightblue", alpha = 0.7, outlier.shape = 24, 
               outlier.fill = "red", outlier.alpha = 0.6, outlier.size = 4) +
  geom_jitter(width = 0.2, alpha = 0.4, color = "darkblue") +
  labs(title = "Life Expectancy by Continent (2007)",
       subtitle = "Individual points show raw data; red points indicate outliers",
       x = "Continent",
       y = "Life Expectancy (years)") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = "bold"),
    axis.title = element_text(size = 14),
    axis.text = element_text(size = 14)
  ) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(40, 85, by = 5))
```

2.  There are no outliers in Oceania's distribution
3.  Asia has both high and low outliers

## Changes Over Time

```{r}
#| fig.height: 8
#| fig.width: 12
time_comparison <- gapminder %>%
  filter(year %in% c(1957, 2007)) %>%
  mutate(year = factor(year))

ggplot(time_comparison, aes(x = continent, y = lifeExp, fill = year)) +
  geom_boxplot(alpha = 0.7, position = "dodge", outlier.shape = 21,
               outlier.alpha = 0.6) +
  labs(title = "Life Expectancy: 1957 vs 2007",
       subtitle = "Comparing distribution changes over 50 years",
       x = "Continent",
       y = "Life Expectancy (years)",
       fill = "Year") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = "bold"),
    axis.title = element_text(size = 12),
    axis.text = element_text(size = 10)
  ) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set2") +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(30, 85, by = 5))
```

### Time Comparison Questions

Answer True or False:

1.  The median life expectancy increased in all continents between 1957 and 2007
2.  The variation in life expectancy (IQR) decreased in most continents over time
3.  Africa showed the smallest improvement in median life expectancy
4.  The spread of life expectancies in Asia decreased substantially from 1957 to 2007
5.  Oceania maintained the highest median life expectancy in both time periods

### Statistical Summary

```{r}
# Calculate summary statistics
summary_stats <- gapminder %>%
  filter(year %in% c(1957, 2007)) %>%
  group_by(continent, year) %>%
  summarise(
    median = median(lifeExp),
    q1 = quantile(lifeExp, 0.25),
    q3 = quantile(lifeExp, 0.75),
    iqr = IQR(lifeExp),
    n_outliers = sum(lifeExp < (q1 - 1.5 * iqr) | lifeExp > (q3 + 1.5 * iqr))
  ) %>%
  arrange(continent, year)

knitr::kable(summary_stats, digits = 1,
             caption = "Summary Statistics by Continent and Year")
```

## Key Learning Points

1.  **Distribution Center**:
    -   Median shows the typical life expectancy
    -   Changes in median reflect overall improvements
2.  **Spread and Variation**:
    -   IQR (box height) indicates data dispersion
    -   Wider boxes suggest more inequality in life expectancy
3.  **Outliers and Extremes**:
    -   Outliers often represent countries with unique circumstances
4.  **Time Comparison**:
    -   Shows both absolute improvements and changes in variation
    -   Highlights persistent regional disparities
    -   Reveals different rates of progress across continents

\* Theoretically problematic but commonly used in practice / Teoretycznie problematyczne, ale powszechnie stosowane w praktyce

### Notes / Uwagi:

1.  Measurement Scales / Skale pomiarowe:

-   **Nominal**: Categories without order / Kategorie bez uporządkowania
-   **Ordinal**: Ordered categories / Kategorie uporządkowane
-   **Interval**: Equal intervals, arbitrary zero / Równe interwały, umowne zero
-   **Ratio**: Equal intervals, absolute zero / Równe interwały, absolutne zero

2.  Practical Considerations / Aspekty praktyczne:

-   Some measures marked with ✓\* are commonly used for interval data despite theoretical issues / Niektóre miary oznaczone ✓\* są powszechnie stosowane dla danych przedziałowych pomimo problemów teoretycznych
-   Choice of measure should consider both theoretical appropriateness and practical utility / Wybór miary powinien uwzględniać zarówno poprawność teoretyczną jak i użyteczność praktyczną
-   More restrictive scales (ratio) allow all measures from less restrictive scales / Bardziej restrykcyjne skale (ilorazowe) pozwalają na wszystkie miary z mniej restrykcyjnych skal
